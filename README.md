It seems like you're looking to combine trade theory, electrical engineering, electronics, and mathematics in your thesis. Here is a potential thesis topic that integrates these areas:

Title: "Integration of Trade Theory in the Design and Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Systems using Mathematical Models"

Abstract:
This thesis explores the integration of trade theory principles in the field of electrical engineering and electronics to optimize the design and functionality of complex systems. By leveraging mathematical models and economic concepts, this study aims to enhance the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance of electrical and electronic systems in various industries.

Research Objectives:
1. Investigate the key principles of trade theory and their applicability in the field of electrical engineering and electronics.
2. Develop mathematical models to represent the interplay between trade-offs, costs, and performance in system design.
3. Analyze case studies to demonstrate the application of trade theory in optimizing electrical and electronic systems.
4. Evaluate the impact of integrating trade theory and mathematical models on the efficiency and sustainability of complex systems.

Methodology:
- Review existing literature on trade theory, electrical engineering principles, and mathematical modeling techniques.
- Develop a framework for integrating trade theory concepts with mathematical models for system optimization.
- Conduct case studies and simulations to demonstrate the practical implications of the proposed approach.
- Analyze the results and draw conclusions on the benefits of incorporating trade theory in electrical and electronic system design.

Potential Contributions:
- This thesis aims to bridge the gap between trade theory and engineering disciplines, offering a novel perspective on system design and optimization.
- The findings could provide valuable insights for practitioners in the field of electrical engineering, electronics, and trade economics.
- The integration of mathematical modeling and trade theory concepts may lead to more efficient and sustainable solutions in complex systems.

By focusing on the intersection of trade theory, electrical engineering, electronics, and mathematics, this thesis has the potential to make a significant contribution to the advancement of interdisciplinary research and innovation in these field
