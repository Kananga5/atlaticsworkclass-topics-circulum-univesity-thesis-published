Dear Tshingombe Tshitadi,

Have you signed in to your AIU Dashboard? Sign in today to complete at least one of the three Academic Documents needed to complete your Phase 1 at AIU. 

These three required documents are found under your Application Form right on your Dashboard, and theyâ€™re incredibly simple to complete. Click on the Submit button next to each in order to upload:

    Your Resume (Curriculum Vitae) compiles your previous academic and professional experience into a one or two-pages document. You can complete it online by clicking on your Digital Resume under your Personal Information menu or simply upload a copy if you already have one
    Your One-Page Autobiography should have a written review of your academic and professional past, your current experiences and your future goals
    Submit a copy of your Latest Academic Degree such as your high school diploma in your Portfolio

We look forward to seeing your Academic Documents uploaded into your Dashboard this week to get you one step closer to your enrollment at AIU.

Sign In Now!

We are here to assist you!

We will be guiding you through this process.
