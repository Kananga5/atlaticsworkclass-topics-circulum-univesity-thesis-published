Description : Montessori Beyond the Materials: There's much more to Montessori than shelves and materials. Though these things are captivating to the child, they do not embody the spirit or philosophy of Montessori. A clear distinction should be made between Montessori materials and the Montessori Method. While Montessori materials complement the pedagogy, they are no substitute for the lifestyle and mindset of authentic Montessori. In this presentation, we'll explore how Montessori is a state of mind, a philosophy, and a way of life beyond the materials.

Weighting: the following weights are consequently awarded to each category STUDENT
  NAME: TSHINGOMBE    TSHITADI 
 ID NUMBER:         
ID   DIPLOMAT NUMBER:
  A National Accredited Technical Education Diploma (NATED) is basically an undergraduate qualification delivered under the auspices of the Quality Council for Trades and Occupations and the Department of Higher Education and Training. These certifications combine theory and practical work, and are registered on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF).”
Learners can embark on engineering studies ranging from N1 to N6 and on humanities courses from N4 to N6. The ultimate goal of the engineering NATED course is to study for an N6 Engineering Diploma, which takes approximately three years to complete, encompassing 18 months of theory and 18 months of practical experience. 
“A National Diploma is completely different from a degree,” explains Ayobolu, “in that the National Diploma is divided into three levels, which are N4, N5 and N6. On completion of each level, learners are issued with a National Certificate.”
This type of qualification is aimed primarily at giving the learner the technical, theoretical, practical and workplace knowledge and skills required in their chosen occupational or vocational area. The courses are designed to enable learners to progressively obtain a qualification by completing the related N4, N5 and N6 courses in a particular vocational or occupational area, either piecemeal with breaks between the courses, or in one extended study period of a year or 18 months. The knowledge and skills learned are then applied in the workplace for an extended period before certification is awarded.
Ayobolu explains how NATED qualifications fit into the academic structure. “According to the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) NQF Act 67 of 2008, the framework consists of 10 levels that are divided into three bands. Levels 1 to 4 are the equivalent of Grades 9 to 12, as well as occupational certificates. Levels 5 to 8 equal higher certificates and diplomas; advanced certificates, degrees and advanced diplomas; honours degrees; postgraduate diplomas and occupational certificates. Levels 9 and 10 are master’s and doctorates, respectively.”
A NATED diploma – on NQF 6 – is one level below a bachelor’s degree. Bachelor’s degrees are NQF level 7 qualifications. It is, however, possible to get your degree, if you meet the applicable requirements, once you have a National Diploma. Once a learner has received their NATED diploma, they can apply to study a B-Tech degree, with the provisos that it has to be in a related field and all admission requirements are met.
There are several advantages to choosing to study towards a NATED diploma. Ayobolu explains: “A NATED diploma allows the learner to develop practical skills founded on the latest theory and principles, combined with an extended period of between 18 and 24 months of on-the-job experience. 
“In addition, the N4, N5 and N6 modules can be completed as individual units of learning that develop specific knowledge and skills. While they form part of the complete qualification, they also equip the learners to be productively employed as second-level technicians.”
The top six advantages of completing a NATED qualification are: 
	At each level a significant volume of learning outcomes will be achieved. This prepares learners for employment, participation in society and community, and access to higher levels of education and training. Further education can lead to higher education studies.
	A certificate is awarded to all learners who successfully complete the requirements at Levels 1 to 5, and an advanced certificate is awarded at Level 6.
	This qualification offers both theoretical and practical learning with a strong workplace learning component.
	The qualification has been compared with qualifications and training offered in countries that have a strong vocational educational and training system designed for young adults, for those who enjoy upskilling themselves on an ongoing basis and for the updating of existing employees’ skills levels.
	Colleges could be more affordable than higher education institutions. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds who are willing to learn could receive financial aid from colleges. The colleges also have a variety of programmes and services, including student support centres.
	Learners are able to study a diploma part time, especially at private institutions and technical colleges. This means that while doing a diploma, the learner can get a part-time job to help pay for tuition fees.
Learners who have completed a NATED diploma will be able to work in a number of specialised positions within their chosen field. They should be aware, however, that certain higher-level positions typically require a degree. The advantage of having a NATED diploma is that the learner will already have a lot of practical experience that they can apply in the workplace. For example, an engineering NATED diploma will allow the learner to perform a wide variety of jobs, such as electrical work or working as a diesel mechanic.
Ayobolu  says: “Whether it’s a learner wanting to follow a more technical career path or an employee wanting to update their skills and earn a formal qualification, the way that NATED courses are structured means that they’re accessible to everyone. They’re also an option for those who simply can’t afford a university degree. With unemployment at an all-time high, as well as huge demand for technical skills, these types of qualifications also empower people to eventually start their own small business.”

ection 3(4)(l) of the National Education Policy Act, 1996 (No. 27 of 1996) makes
provision for the determination of national education policy regarding curriculum
frameworks, core syllabuses and education programmes, learning standards,
examinations and the certification of qualifications, subject to the provisions of any
law establishing a national qualifications framework or a certifying or accrediting
body.
The policy document, Formal technical college instructional programmes in the RSA,
Report 191 (2001/08), contains the programme requirements for current technical
college education in the Republic of South Africa. The Report serves as a manual and
is an educational policy document, which lists all instructional programmes approved
by the Minister of Education in accordance with the National Education Policy Act
1996, (Act No. 27 of 1996).
The policy document, Norms and standards for instructional programmes and the
examination and certification thereof in technical college education, Report 190
(2000/03) is a separate policy document containing broad, general provisions with
regard to technical college education, pertaining to norms and standards for
instructional programmes, examinations and certification. More detailed particulars
regarding the various instructional programmes offered by technical colleges are
contained in the policy document, Formal technical college instructional programmes
in the RSA, Report 2001 (2001/08).
The policy document, Formal technical college instructional programmes in the RSA,
Report 191 (2001/08) has at this stage only a maintenance function and will be
gradually replaced by a new Further Education and Training (FET) policy document
which will accommodate the national norms and standards for FET, as stipulated in the
Education White Paper 4: A programme for the transformation of Further Education
and Training, August 1998 and the Further Education and Training Act, 1998 (Act No.
98 of 1998).

Sequence of delivery 
The sequence of delivery of the Units within the National 4 Engineering Science Course is at the discretion of the centre, and the models suggested below simply exemplify possible approaches which may be developed to suit individual circumstances and resources. 
The example structures outlined below are similar to those shown in the National 5 Course Support Notes so that centres may plan, where applicable, for delivery to mixed level groups. (Further suggestions and specific advice can be found in the Unit Support Notes.) 
Fitting the Added Value Unit into a Course plan 
Note that the delivery of the Added Value Unit (Engineering Science Assignment) has been omitted from the diagrams and examples which follow. As the Added Value Unit is intended to build on knowledge, understanding and skills developed through the other Units, it will normally be delivered at the end of the Course. However, it may be possible to begin work on the Added Value Unit at an earlier stage, but only where it is clear that learners have already gained the required skills and knowledge. 
Example 1a: Sequential delivery of the Units, beginning with Engineering Contexts and Challenges 
In this example, the three Units are delivered sequentially, beginning with Engineering Contexts and Challenges, which provides an introduction to some important concepts which underpin the whole Course, including the systems approach and energy. 
The other two Units — Electronics and Control, and Mechanisms and Structures — may then follow, deepening the learners’ experience in these more focused areas. These two Units may




In this approach, the induction phase introduces the learner to the systems approach. This might involve the analysis of simple products and engineered systems. Typically this stage will only require a short time, but the systems approach will permeate the Course and so the learner’s knowledge and ability to analyse the engineered world will develop throughout the whole Course. 
The second phase, occupying most of the Course time, is where the majority of the engineering knowledge and skills are introduced and then developed. The modules may be taught in any order and covered in a linear or concurrent manner. 
In the final phase, the more demanding engineering concepts are

submitting for printing			
oderate 10% or a minimum of 5 written assessments 
• Moderators should familiarise themselves with the assessment 
• The marked scripts selected for moderation should reflect best, 
medium and poor performance. 
• Moderators should use a green pen only. 
• Moderators should re-mark the entire script and also 
show all √ as indicated on the assessment tool. 
Subject Moderator 
(Subject expert: 
empower all staff ! 
peer moderation) 
Within 2 days after the 
marked assessments 
were handed to the 
moderator 
Feedback to marker: 
• Keep all evidence of the moderation process (E.g. 55 % / 66 %) 
Subject Moderator Within 2 days after the 
marked assessments 
were handed to the 
moderator 
Re-marking is strongly advised in the following instances: 
• If the variance between the marker’s and moderator’s marks is greater 
than 5% for more than half of the moderated scripts. 
(Note: A remark of the entire batch is advised if the variance is 
applicable to more than half of the sample moderated) 
• If the variance between the marker’s and moderator’s marks is the 
result of incorrect marking. 
(Note: Sections/specific question/s indicated by the moderator of 
the entire batch must be remarked.) 
Examples of incorrect marking: 
Awarding marks for incorrect answers 
Not awarding marks for correct answers 
Not marking alternative correct answers 
Incorrect allocation of marks 
• 

• o Inconsistent mark allocation for similar answers 
Marker Within 2 days after 
feedback was received 
from the moderator 
If re-marking was advised, 10 % of the entire batch should be moderated 
again on completion of re-marking. 
Subject Moderator Within 2 days after re-
marking 
Errors in the adding of marks made by the marker: 
• Add and check totals of all scripts again 
(Note: If for example, an adding error was made by the 
marker, the student must be given the correct (moderated) mark. 
The moderator should determine whether the error was restricted to 
the one script only. The moderator should moderate one or two 
additional scripts) 

Marker 
Hand assessments back to students 
• The converted mark must be indicated on the marked task, e.g. 
60/100 = 60% = 45/75. 
Lecturer First contact session 
with students 
Capturing of marks on IT system: 
After the moderation is completed the lecturer’s (red 
pen) marks must be captured on the IT system. 
(Note: All students must benefit from the moderation and not only the 
sample of scripts moderated. The aim of moderation is to ensure 
consistency in the marking process) 
Corrections should be done (Note: As part of remedial work the lecturer 
should go through the task with the students)

To allow for creativity and resourcefulness when achieving Learning Outcomes, to cater for different learning 
styles and use a range of assessment methods, instruments and techniques. 
• Participation 
To enable stakeholders to participate in setting standards and co-ordinating the achievement of the 
qualification. 
• Access 
To address barriers to learning at each level to facilitate students’ progress. 
Applied Policing 
National Certificates (Vocational) Department of Education 3 
• Progression 
To ensure that the qualification framework permits individuals to move through the levels of the national 
qualification via different, appropriate combinations of the components of the delivery system. 
• Portability 
To enable students to transfer credits of qualifications from one learning institution and/or employer to 
another institution or employer. 
• Articulation 
To allow for vertical and horizontal mobility in the education system when accredited pre-requisites have 
been successfully completed. 
• Recognition of Prior Learning 
To grant credits for a unit of learning following an assessment or if a student possesses the capabilities 
specified in the outcomes statement. 
• Validity of assessments 
To ensure assessment covers a broad range of knowledge, skills, values and attitudes (SKVAs) needed to 
demonstrate applied competency. This is achieved through: 
 clearly stating the outcome to be assessed; 
 selecting the appropriate or suitable evidence; 
 matching the evidence with a compatible or appropriate method of assessment; and 
 selecting and constructing an instrument(s) of assessment. 
• Reliability 
To assure assessment practices are consistent so that the same result or judgment is arrived at if the 
assessment is replicated in the same context. This demands consistency in the interpretation of evidence; 
therefore, careful monitoring of assessment is vital. 
• Fairness and transparency 
To verify that no assessment process or method(s) hinders or unfairly advantages any student. The following 
could constitute unfairness in assessment: 
 Inequality of opportunities, resources or teaching and learning approaches 
 Bias based on ethnicity, race, gender, age, disability or social class 
 Lack of clarity regarding Learning Outcome being assessed 
 Comparison of students’ work with other students, based on learning styles and language 
• Practicability and cost-effectiveness 
To integrate assessment practices within an outcomes-based education and training system and strive for 
cost and time-effective assessment. 
2 ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR VOCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS 
The assessment structure for the National Certificates (Vocational) qualification is as follows: 
2.1 Internal continuous assessment (ICASS) 
Knowledge, skills values, and attitudes (SKVAs) are assessed throughout the year using assessment 
instruments such as projects, tests, assignments, investigations, role-play and case studies. The internal 
continuous assessment (ICASS) practical component is undertaken in a real workplace, a workshop or a 
“Structured Environment”. This component is moderated internally and externally quality assured by Umalusi. 
All internal continuous assessment (ICASS) evidence is kept in a Portfolio of Evidence (PoE) and must be 
readily available for monitoring, moderation and verification purposes. 
2.2 External summative assessment (ESASS) 
The external summative assessment is either a single or a set of written papers set to the requirements of 
the Subject Learning Outcomes. The Department of Education administers the theoretical component 
according to relevant assessment policies. 
Applied Policing Level 4 (January 2020) 
National Certificates (Vocational) Department of Education 4 
A compulsory component of external summative assessment (ESASS) is the integrated summative 
assessment task (ISAT). This assessment task draws on the students’ cumulative learning throughout the 
year. The task requires integrated application of competence and is executed under strict assessment 
conditions. The task should take place in a simulated or “Structured Environment”. The integrated summative 
assessment task (ISAT) is the most significant test of students’ ability to apply acquired knowledge. The integrated assessment approach allows students to be assessed in more than one subject with the 
same integrated summative assessment task (ISAT). External summative assessments will be conducted annually between October and December, with 
provision made for supplementary sittings. 
3 MODERATION OF ASSESSMENT 3.1 Internal moderation 
Assessment must be moderated according to the internal moderation policy of the Further Education and 
Training (FET) college. Internal college moderation is a continuous process. The moderator’s involvement 
starts with the planning of assessment methods and instruments and follows with continuous collaboration 
with and support to the assessors. Internal moderation creates common understanding of Assessment 
Standards and maintains these across vocational programmes. 
3.2 External moderation 
External moderation is conducted by the Department of Education, Umalusi and, where relevant, an 
Education and Training Quality Assurance (ETQA) body according to South African Qualifications Authority 
(SAQA) and Umalusi standards and requirements. The external moderator: 
• monitors and evaluates the standard of all summative assessments; 
• maintains standards by exercising appropriate influence and control over assessors; 
• ensures proper procedures are followed; 
• ensures summative integrated assessments are correctly administered; 
• observes a minimum sample of ten (10) to twenty-five (25) percent of summative assessments; 
• gives written feedback to the relevant quality assuror; and 
• moderates in case of a dispute between an assessor and a student. Policy on inclusive education requires that assessment procedures be customised for students who 
experience barriers to learning, and supported to enable these students to achieve their maximum potential. 
4 PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF INTERNAL CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT (ICASS) 
The period of validity of the internal continuous assessment mark is determined by the National Policy on the 
Conduct, Administration and Management of the Assessment of the National Certificates (Vocational). The internal continuous assessment (ICASS) must be re-submitted with each examination enrolment for 
which it constitutes a component. 
5 ASSESSOR REQUIREMENTS 
Assessors must be subject specialists and should ideally be declared competent against the standards set 
by the ETDP SETA. If the lecturer conducting the assessments has not been declared a competent 
assessor, an assessor who has been declared competent may be appointed to oversee the assessment 
process to ensure the quality and integrity of assessments. 
6 TYPES OF ASSESSMENT 
Assessment benefits the student and the lecturer. It informs students about their progress and helps 
lecturers make informed decisions at different stages of the learning process. Depending on the intended 
purpose, different types of assessment can be used. 
Applied Policing 
National Certificates (Vocational) Department of Education 5 
6.1 Baseline assessment 
At the beginning of a level or learning experience, baseline assessment establishes the knowledge, skills, 
values and attitudes (SKVAs) that students bring to the classroom. This knowledge assists lecturers to plan 
learning programmes and learning activities. 
6.2 Diagnostic assessment 
This assessment diagnoses the nature and causes of learning barriers experienced by specific students. It is 
followed by guidance, appropriate support and intervention strategies. This type of assessment is useful to 
make referrals for students requiring specialist help. 
6.3 Formative assessment 
This assessment monitors and supports teaching and learning. It determines student strengths and 
weaknesses and provides feedback on progress. It determines if a student is ready for summative 
assessment. 
6.4 Summative assessment 
This type of assessment gives an overall picture of student progress at a given time. It determines whether 
the student is sufficiently competent to progress to the next level. 
7 PLANNING ASSESSMENT 
An assessment plan should cover three main processes: 
7.1 Collecting evidence 
The assessment plan indicates which Subject Outcomes and Assessment Standards will be assessed, what 
assessment method or activity will be used and when this assessment will be conducted. 
7.2 Recording 
Recording refers to the assessment instruments or tools with which the assessment will be captured or 
recorded. Therefore, appropriate assessment instruments must be developed or adapted. 
7.3 Reporting 
All the evidence is put together in a report to deliver a decision for the subject. 
8 METHODS OF ASSESSMENT

ASSESSMENT IN APPLIED POLICING 
1 SCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENT 
At NQF levels 2, 3 and 4, lecturers will conduct assessments as well as develop a schedule of formal 
assessments that will be undertaken in the year. All three levels also have an external examination that 
accounts for 50 percent of the total mark. The marks allocated to assessment tasks completed during the 
year, kept or recorded in a PoE account for the other 50 percent. The PoE and the external assessment include practical and written components. The practical assessment 
in Applied Policing (Level 4) must, where necessary, be subjected to external moderation by Umlauts or an 
appropriate Education and Training Quality Assurance (ETQA) body, appointed by the Umlauts Council in 
terms of Section 28(2) of the General and Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Act, 2001 (Act 
No. 58 of 2001).

Career Overview 
A police officer prevents combats and investigates crime. They are called to criminal situations such as robberies, domestic incidents, drug busts and the like.  In addition to this, policer officers patrol the streets to look out for suspicious activity.  They are trained to defend themselves and those in need of defence.  Within a police station, there is a ranking system.  The ranks in the police force are as follows:
	Detective
	Corporal
	Sergeant
	Lieutenant
	Captain
	Deputy chief
	Chief

The Electrical Conformance Board of South Africa takes it’s role as the national umbrella body for the electrical sector seriously. We constantly try to help and answer all questions as quickly as possible and also help to mediate between conflicting parties.
Please be aware that the ECB is a Not for Profit organisation and as such we are limited by our resources and budget to help you. Please be patient as we have in excess of 7,000 cases each year and we want to ensure each case gets the time it deserves.
If you are happy with the work we do for you and the industry please feel free to send us a donation. We really appreciate everyone of our contributors that help us make the electrical sector a safer.

It's dispiriting to see that even after being made aware of the breach 2 weeks ago, IA has still not done the due diligence of rotating many of the API keys that were exposed in their gitlab secrets.
As demonstrated by this message, this includes a Zendesk token with perms to access 800K+ support tickets sent to info@archive.org since 2018.
Whether you were trying to ask a general question, or requesting the removal of your site from the Wayback Machine—your data is now in the hands of some random guy. If not me, it'd be someone else.
Here's hoping that they'll get their shit together now.

 1.9 Basic requirements:
- balanced pressure: hot and cold water pressure must be of equal pressure to all mixers mixing point showers or hand showers this is achieved by supplying the cold water on the low pressure side of the pressure control valve .
- valve settings and colour codes:
4000kpa valve, red label. ,,600 kpa valve green label..
Anti siphon loop : anti- siphon loop is required on all systems balanced and unbalanced the horizontal supply pipe must be higher than the top of the cylinder the balanced cold draw - off must be connected on the downstream side of the pressure control valve..
- drip stray : sans 1151 specifications for hot water cylinder hwc ,, requirements that the cylinder be mounted within a drip tray and the vacuum breakers and all other valve are installed over the drip tray..
- expansion relief valve : normal expansion is approximately ,,1,5 % to 4 % of volume of water heater per hearing cycle..
- the drain relief pipe must ..
- be piped at decline.
- not interconnected with the safety valve drain pipe .
- not discharge into the drip tray.
Discharge with visible and not be a potential nuisance.
- be protected against Frist ..
- expansion drain pipe to be braced .. expansion will take place water is heated..
- vacuum breaker : to prevent geyser back siphon geyser collapse and to facilitate servicing vacuums breakers must be fitted to the inlet and outlet of hwc ..
- general requirements:
- all pipes must be flushed clean before putting the system into operation the expansion relief valve must be removed for flushing purposes.
- water flow must be in the direction of the arrow on the multi valve body.
- valve must be easily accessible for service.
- allow a minimum clearence of 200 mm for parts removal.
- do not install a stopcok or non ,return valve between the hwc and the multi pressure control valve.
- do not install a stopc or non return valve and the vacuum breakers on either the got or cold side ..
- to minimise temperature change and excessive drop in volume ensure that supply pipes are adequately size.
- the inlet pipe size to multi valve is to be the same size as the connection fitting on the valve .

- the valves pressure settings will not be altered with cleaning.
- turn on the water supply at at integral isolating valve..
- replacement parts :
Khn3-102c| cartridge for pressure reducer  200kpa..
- khn3 -104 C ,, cartridge for pressure reducer ,400kpa

6. Fault finding:
Fault |probable cause|recommended sol
A- excessive leak from expansion drain pipe  hot water | requirement for balanced pressure to mixing points is not adhered to incorrect or unbalanced installation.| Balance hot and cold supply if possible fit spring loaded non  return valve after vacuum breakers to hot water outlet of the xyly.

B- excessive leak or continuous drip from expansion drain pipe cold water | geyser thermostat is not switching off | switch off electricity supply to geyser ,turn on hot tap for few seconds .wait five minuy and check whether the drip has stopped if not the valve requirements service or cleaning the expansion relief valve contains replaceable valve seat which is made of stainless steel..

C- full bore flow they expansion drain pipe but no cold hot water when installation is complete| there is foreign matter on the main seat the main seat is worn incorrect valve direction | clean the valve ,replace cartridge..reverse the valve body water must flow in the directly of the arrow on the valve body..

D- insufficient or no cold hot water.| Strainer is blocked stopcock in main supply is partly or fully closed inadequate system pressure.| Clean stainer ,open stopcock fully see installatt requirements.
E- water hammer during valve opens..| undersized piping incorrect valve installation the piping is loose air is trapped inside the pipe excessive pressure drop in the system |™increase pipe size ,reverse valve secure all piping fit autmyair release valve increase pipe size.
F - vibration in system , excessive water water velocity loose washer plate assembly in the stopcoks,faulty washer in the Tao ,stopcokbor mixer ,inlet pipe under ,sized

Problem consider a 20kv network that supplies a HV / LV substation via 2 m overhead  line and MVA generator that supplies in parallel the busbare of the same substation two 1000kva parallel connected transformers euply the LV,busbar which in turn supply 29out gears to 20 motor including the one supplying motor .all motor are rate 50kw all connections cable are identical and all motor are running when  the fault occurs the isc3a d up value must be calculated at the variouse fault location indicated in the network diagram.
-point A on the HV busbars with a negligible impedance.
-point B on the LV busbar,at a distance of meter from the transformer.
-Point c  on the busbar of an LV su distribution board .

-short circuit: condition the load will be served by a 1500kva transformer at 480,3 phase through a single motor control centre the fault current availability from the utilities on the source side of transformer is unknown ,the transformer is approximately,75% of the rating of the transformer note that standard transformer impedance is valued at +1-7,5% of nominal , therefore a conservative calculation the lowest impedance should be used 
5,75%((100%-7,5%)÷100=5,32%
-the current flowing during a fault at any point in an electrical system is limited by the impedance of the circuit and equipment from the source or source to the point where the fault has occurred for these simplified calculation we will assume that only source are the transformer and the motor connected to the system the motor are connected in parallel with the transformer as an impedance with an infinite bus as the source of the fault current 
- short circuit current= driving voltage /total impedance (ohm,
A point -to- calculation of short circuit current available at any point can using it the basic used per unit calcul short circuit 
-value in electric power circuit the reactance of the utility systeme must be assumed  zero ,and the following 
-approximate transformer per - unit ,Z=(%Z)(base KVA )÷(100)(transfo KVA)
Base KVA = transfo KVA

-7.9.explain: .the bits and pieces of a bit .you don't have to make your robot body elaborate to make it Google body elaborate make a simple and shirdy body by using common tools and readily available material simple can building square shaped body more easily .
-introducing rover the robot .
-fairly simple robot that gives perfect intro to robot building just staring .
,- in the basic rover ,use two small DC gear motor to control it's movement ,by using a pair motor to control it's movement ,by using a pair of wired switches gear motor motor are like regular motor , except they also of gears that make the motor more ,propelling the switch down up and down its lot more fun that if sound especially if have car dog to chose around don't worry no animal will be harmed during this project .
- the advance rover use a microcontroller , specifically e basic stamp 2,to building self contained autonomous robot , with verst your program the  microcontroller for what you won't rover to do this smart rover uses specialised motor that you have to take operate and and modify you ,
,-;preparing to building the bot .
Befot you can drill your first Hade or fasten your first but ,you need to layout design of your robot ,acquire LL the material and sort.
 
-first get your self a template.
Although you use a circuit schematic for simple projects ,you graduate to something called ,a cutting and drilling template for making a robot this template  as the layout for your robot  draw the layout scale ,that the size and shape that you want the finished piece to ,-be-on a piece of paper.
 
- the cuttt and drilling template for river two - deck tablet robot the dimensions used .in this template are measure.
Inch the template include the two body piece we call decks ,like the decks of a ship ,there s a bottom deck and top deck ,you attach ,the motor wheel to the bottom decks ,top deck is left free for future enhancement such an add ..
 
 
Draw ,
---------------
 
Gathering your material rudimentary construction skill to build rover using .
 
- 1/4inch hardwood plywood ,a good choice ,is 5-ply our craft plywood available at any hobby store
-1/4 inch rigid plastic you can this plastic Stores.
- if you re nor careful , acrylic can shaftle  when you re drilling or cutting IL.
- acrylic drill tools Mather quickly
-acrylix  generate a ton of static electricity.
-gating  piece : machine screws size.
When using stand off as rises the minimum length that you can use ,2/2 inch ,1-or,1.1/2 inch standoff work.
- if you re using machine screw distance between deck piece plus thickness of the deck piece , material thickness of the retaining nut ,want inch. Of clearance and you 're using 2/4inch thick wook ,or PVC ,the machine screws must .
 
- building the body of the bot plan material in hand actually start construction,so put on you your hard ,and ,oh don't forget .
 
- cutting and drilling the piece of robot body first step building process is to use the robot layout from , fig ,,15-1to drill holes for mounting parts and the cut the deck piece .
 
- layout the holes and cutting dimension from the template ,15-1 directly wood or plastic material on better yet draw the m first on a piece of papper the tape paper over the wood or plastic material.
 
-when all look right ,drill holes for rover using a 2/8,inch drill bik , not drill Manuel,drill press Helt accurate holes.
 
-after you finish drilling cut the piece to size used hacsiw ,coping saw jigsaw ,band saw it prove control
 
-sand Draw the cornea of the piece to produce bevels edge more sharp angle at each corner cut rover .
 
 
- Assembling and mounting the motor set a side the body piece for now and turn to assembling the two gear motor you put these motor together by following the instructions your motor Phillips screw drivers to assemble the motor  note that the screw driver does come in the kit si you  need to buy one if you don't already have need small hex key wrench ,attach motor ..

Yours sincerely,

Here you will see what your estimated electricity cost and usage is, and energy savings tips to help you bring your costs down. If you input your usage data every month, we will record your data here. In time, with enough users inputting their data, you will see how your usage decreases and compares to others in your area. Thank you for being energy conscious!

Savings tips 
 
lighting
1.       Replace all your CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lamps) with energy saving LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) - switch off lights in all unoccupied rooms.
2.       Install day-night sensors on outdoor security lights.
3.       Ensure that your oven door is closed until the food is done - opening and closing it wastes energy.

Description : Montessori Beyond the Materials: There's much more to Montessori than shelves and materials. Though these things are captivating to the child, they do not embody the spirit or philosophy of Montessori. A clear distinction should be made between Montessori materials and the Montessori Method. While Montessori materials complement the pedagogy, they are no substitute for the lifestyle and mindset of authentic Montessori. In this presentation, we'll explore how Montessori is a state of mind, a philosophy, and a way of life beyond the materials.

he history of telecommunications
1. Part 1 | History of telephony, how it all started 
2. Part 2 | Rapid growth of telephony 
3. Part 3 | Transatlantic telephone: crossing the ocean 
4. Part 4 | Area codes and the first portable phone 
5. Part 5 | Martin Cooper’s first mobile phone 
6. Part 6 | Toll-free service numbers 
7. Part 7 | The rise of digital telephony 
8. Part 8 | The future of telecommunications 
In this series we explore the history of telecommunications in all its facets.
 We already told you about the rise and evolution of toll-free servive numbers and the first mobile phone. In this article you’ll learn more about the further evolution of digital telephony and mobile telephones; from large analogue machines to the intelligent smartphone as we all know it.
3 generations: 1G, 2G and 3G
When the first mobile phone appeared in the ’80s there were different mobile networks throughout the world. Frontrunner was  Japan, where the first commercial network in the world was already active in 1979. At first it was just Tokyo that was connected, but within 5 years the rest of the country had joined the capital. The USA followed soon after, and  Europe responded by setting up Global System for Mobile Communications, or GSM.
All these different networks had one thing in common: they could only be used for calls through the analogue network, but soon the 1G network made a name for itself. In 1991 the first digital mobile network was implemented in Finland by Radiolinja, what later became part of Elisa Oyj. This network was labelled 2G; the second generation of wireless telephone technology. 2G had a few advantages. Information could be transferred encrypted over the digital network, it was more efficient and 2G made it possible to send data as well – like SMS and MMS. And everything was secured digitally.
Though the mobile network evolved rapidly with the introduction of 3G in 2001 and 4G in 2014, the 2g network is still being used today in some parts of the world, but more and more countries choose to gradually shut down their 2G networks.
Digital telephony and smartphones
Already in the ’70s Theodor G. Paraskevakos developed the concept of a phone that could connect intelligence and data processing with a virtual display. This concept could be realized once 2G made it possible to send data over the network.
 There are several answers to the question who introduced the first smartphone to the market. In the middle of the ’90s there were 2 devices which could be used to call, email and fax, and a digital calendar was built in as well. These were the early versions of the smartphone:
	In 1994 BellSouth introduced the Simon Personal Communicator.
	In 1996 introduced Nokia their Nokia Communicator.
The Nokia Communicator (photo on the right) had all the functionalities of a personal computer, like email, web browsing, word processing, and combined these with fax and telephony. The device costed over 800 dollar and was everything but handy and easy to use, which scared away consumers and kept them from buying one. The owner of Nokia at that time, Jorma Ollia, stated: “We had exactly the right view of what it was all about… We were about 5 years ahead.”
The first smartphones were primarily suitable for business use, because of the high prices and unpractical design. Its main use was that of personal digital assistent.
The name ‘smartphone’ was coined by Ericsson in 2000, in a campaign to increase its popularity amongst consumers as well. With the introduction of the 3G network (in 2001) and the arrival of lighter, more simple devices at the same time the smartphone finally became a hit. In 2007, the year that Apple launched the first iPhone, already 8 million people worldwide had used a smartphone to visit the internet, and in 2012 there were over 1 billion smartphone users worldwide. It’s estimated that by 2017 the number of smartphone users will approach 2,5 billion. This makes us wonder what technological developments the near future has in store for us – something we’ll discuss in the final part of this series.

See also: quantum state space and configuration space (physics)
In control engineering and system identification, a state-space representation is a mathematical model of a physical system specified as a set of input, output, and variables related by first-order differential equations or difference equations. Such variables, called state variables, evolve over time in a way that depends on the values they have at any given instant and on the externally imposed values of input variables. Output variables’ values depend on the state variable values and may also depend on the input variable values. 
The state space or phase space is the geometric space in which the axes are the state variables. The system state can be represented as a vector, the state vector. 
If the dynamical system is linear, time-invariant, and finite-dimensional, then the differential and algebraic equations may be written in matrix form.[1][2] The state-space method is characterized by the algebraization of general system theory, which makes it possible to use Kronecker vector-matrix structures. The capacity of these structures can be efficiently applied to research systems with or without modulation.[3] The state-space representation (also known as the "time-domain approach") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With  inputs and  outputs, we would otherwise have to write down  Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. 
The state-space model can be applied in subjects such as economics,[4] statistics,[5] computer science and electrical engineering,[6] and neuroscience.[7] In econometrics, for example, state-space models can be used to decompose a time series into trend and cycle, compose individual indicators into a composite index,[8] identify turning points of the business cycle, and estimate GDP using latent and unobserved time series.[9][10] Many applications rely on the Kalman Filter or a state observer to produce estimates of the current unknown state variables using their previous observations.[11][12] 
State variables
The internal state variables are the smallest possible subset of system variables that can represent the entire state of the system at any given time.[13] The minimum number of state variables required to represent a given system,  , is usually equal to the order of the system's defining differential equation, but not necessarily. If the system is represented in transfer function form, the minimum number of state variables is equal to the order of the transfer function's denominator after it has been reduced to a proper fraction. It is important to understand that converting a state-space realization to a transfer function form may lose some internal information about the system, and may provide a description of a system which is stable, when the state-space realization is unstable at certain points. In electric circuits, the number of state variables is often, though not always, the same as the number of energy storage elements in the circuit such as capacitors and inductors. The state variables defined must be linearly independent, i.e., no state variable can be written as a linear combination of the other state variables, or the system cannot be solved. 
Linear systems
 Block diagram representation of the linear state-space equations 
The most general state-space representation of a linear system with  inputs,  outputs and  state variables is written in the following form:[14]   
where: 
	 is called the "state vector",   ;
	 is called the "output vector",   ;
	 is called the "input (or control) vector",   ;
	 is the "state (or system) matrix",   ,
	 is the "input matrix",   ,
	 is the "output matrix",   ,
	 is the "feedthrough (or feedforward) matrix" (in cases where the system model does not have a direct feedthrough,  is the zero matrix),   ,
	 .
In this general formulation, all matrices are allowed to be time-variant (i.e. their elements can depend on time); however, in the common LTI case, matrices will be time invariant. The time variable  can be continuous (e.g.  ) or discrete (e.g.  ). In the latter case, the time variable  is usually used instead of  . Hybrid systems allow for time domains that have both continuous and discrete parts. Depending on the assumptions made, the state-space model representation can assume the following forms:

Example: continuous-time LTI case
Stability and natural response characteristics of a continuous-time LTI system (i.e., linear with matrices that are constant with respect to time) can be studied from the eigenvalues of the matrix  . The stability of a time-invariant state-space model can be determined by looking at the system's transfer function in factored form. It will then look something like this: 
 
The denominator of the transfer function is equal to the characteristic polynomial found by taking the determinant of  ,  The roots of this polynomial (the eigenvalues) are the system transfer function's poles (i.e., the singularities where the transfer function's magnitude is unbounded). These poles can be used to analyze whether the system is asymptotically stable or marginally stable. An alternative approach to determining stability, which does not involve calculating eigenvalues, is to analyze the system's Lyapunov stability. 
The zeros found in the numerator of  can similarly be used to determine whether the system is minimum phase. 
The system may still be input–output stable (see BIBO stable) even though it is not internally stable. This may be the case if unstable poles are canceled out by zeros (i.e., if those singularities in the transfer function are removable). 
Controllability
Main article: Controllability
The state controllability condition implies that it is possible – by admissible inputs – to steer the states from any initial value to any final value within some finite time window. A continuous time-invariant linear state-space model is controllable if and only if  where rank is the number of linearly independent rows in a matrix, and where n is the number of state variables. 
Observability
Main article: Observability
Observability is a measure for how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs. The observability and controllability of a system are mathematical duals (i.e., as controllability provides that an input is available that brings any initial state to any desired final state, observability provides that knowing an output trajectory provides enough information to predict the initial state of the system). 
A continuous time-invariant linear state-space model is observable if and only if  
Transfer function
The "transfer function" of a continuous time-invariant linear state-space model can be derived in the following way: 
First, taking the Laplace transform of  
yields  Next, we simplify for  , giving  and thus  
Substituting for  in the output equation 
 giving  
Assuming zero initial conditions  and a single-input single-output (SISO) system, the transfer function is defined as the ratio of output and input  . For a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, however, this ratio is not defined. Therefore, assuming zero initial conditions, the transfer function matrix is derived from  
using the method of equating the coefficients which yields 
 
Consequently,  is a matrix with the dimension  which contains transfer functions for each input output combination. Due to the simplicity of this matrix notation, the state-space representation is commonly used for multiple-input, multiple-output systems. The Rosenbrock system matrix provides a bridge between the state-space representation and its transfer function. 
Canonical realizations
Main article: Realization (systems)
Any given transfer function which is strictly proper can easily be transferred into state-space by the following approach (this example is for a 4-dimensional, single-input, single-output system): 
Given a transfer function, expand it to reveal all coefficients in both the numerator and denominator. This should result in the following form:  
The coefficients can now be inserted directly into the state-space model by the following approach:  
 
This state-space realization is called controllable canonical form because the resulting model is guaranteed to be controllable (i.e., because the control enters a chain of integrators, it has the ability to move every state). 
The transfer function coefficients can also be used to construct another type of canonical form   
This state-space realization is called observable canonical form because the resulting model is guaranteed to be observable (i.e., because the output exits from a chain of integrators, every state has an effect on the output). 
Proper transfer functions
Transfer functions which are only proper (and not strictly proper) can also be realised quite easily. The trick here is to separate the transfer function into two parts: a strictly proper part and a constant.  
The strictly proper transfer function can then be transformed into a canonical state-space realization using techniques shown above. The state-space realization of the constant is trivially  . Together we then get a state-space realization with matrices A, B and C determined by the strictly proper part, and matrix D determined by the constant. 
Here is an example to clear things up a bit:  which yields the following controllable realization   Notice how the output also depends directly on the input. This is due to the  constant in the transfer function. 
Feedback
 Typical state-space model with feedback 
A common method for feedback is to multiply the output by a matrix K and setting this as the input to the system:  . Since the values of K are unrestricted the values can easily be negated for negative feedback. The presence of a negative sign (the common notation) is merely a notational one and its absence has no impact on the end results. 
  
becomes 
  
solving the output equation for  and substituting in the state equation results in 
  
The advantage of this is that the eigenvalues of A can be controlled by setting K appropriately through eigendecomposition of  . This assumes that the closed-loop system is controllable or that the unstable eigenvalues of A can be made stable through appropriate choice of K. 
Example
For a strictly proper system D equals zero. Another fairly common situation is when all states are outputs, i.e. y = x, which yields C = I, the identity matrix. This would then result in the simpler equations 
  
This reduces the necessary eigendecomposition to just  . 
Feedback with setpoint (reference) input
 Output feedback with set point 
In addition to feedback, an input,  , can be added such that  . 
  
becomes 
  
solving the output equation for  and substituting in the state equation results in 
  
One fairly common simplification to this system is removing D, which reduces the equations to 
  
Moving object example
A classical linear system is that of one-dimensional movement of an object (e.g., a cart). Newton's laws of motion for an object moving horizontally on a plane and attached to a wall with a spring: 
 
where 
	 is position;  is velocity;  is acceleration
	 is an applied force
	 is the viscous friction coefficient
	 is the spring constant
	 is the mass of the object
The state equation would then become 
  
where 
	 represents the position of the object
	 is the velocity of the object
	 is the acceleration of the object
	the output  is the position of the object
The controllability test is then 
 
which has full rank for all  and  . This means, that if initial state of the system is known ( ,  ,  ), and if the  and  are constants, then there is a force  that could move the cart into any other position in the system. 
The observability test is then 
 
which also has full rank. Therefore, this system is both controllable and observable. 
Nonlinear systems
The more general form of a state-space model can be written as two functions. 
  
The first is the state equation and the latter is the output equation. If the function  is a linear combination of states and inputs then the equations can be written in matrix notation like above. The  argument to the functions can be dropped if the system is unforced (i.e., it has no inputs). 
Pendulum example
A classic nonlinear system is a simple unforced pendulum 
 
where 
	 is the angle of the pendulum with respect to the direction of gravity
	 is the mass of the pendulum (pendulum rod's mass is assumed to be zero)
	 is the gravitational acceleration
	 is coefficient of friction at the pivot point
	 is the radius of the pendulum (to the center of gravity of the mass  )
The state equations are then 
  
where 
	 is the angle of the pendulum
	 is the rotational velocity of the pendulum
	 is the rotational acceleration of the pendulum
Instead, the state equation can be written in the general form 
 
The equilibrium/stationary points of a system are when  and so the equilibrium points of a pendulum are those that satisfy 
 
for integers n.

Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture[1] (ATCA or AdvancedTCA) is the largest specification effort in the history of the PCI Industrial Computer Manufacturers Group (PICMG), with more than 100 companies participating. Known as AdvancedTCA, the official specification designation PICMG 3.x (see below) was ratified by the PICMG organization in December 2002.[2] AdvancedTCA is targeted primarily to requirements for "carrier grade" communications equipment, but has recently expanded its reach into more ruggedized applications geared toward the military/aerospace industries as well.[3] This series of specifications incorporates the latest trends in high speed interconnect technologies, next-generation processors, and improved Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS). 
Mechanical specifications
 12U 14-slot AdvancedTCA shelf 
An AdvancedTCA board (blade) is 280 mm deep and 322 mm high. The boards have a metal front panel and a metal cover on the bottom of the printed circuit board to limit electromagnetic interference and to limit the spread of fire. The locking injector-ejector handle (lever) actuates a microswitch to let the Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC) know that an operator wants to remove a board, or that the board has just been installed, thus activating the hot-swap procedure. AdvancedTCA boards support the use of PCI Mezzanine Card (PMC) or Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) expansion mezzanines. 
The shelf supports RTMs (Rear Transition Modules). RTMs plug into the back of the shelf in slot locations that match the front boards. The RTM and the front board are interconnected through a Zone-3 connector. The Zone-3 connector is not defined by the AdvancedTCA specification. 
Each shelf slot is 30.48 mm wide. This allows for 14-board chassis to be installed in a 19-inch rack-mountable system and 16 boards in an ETSI rack-mountable system. A typical 14-slot system is 12 or 13 rack units high. The large AdvancedTCA shelves are targeted to the telecommunication market so the airflow goes in the front of the shelf, across the boards from bottom to top, and out the rear of the shelf. Smaller shelves that are used in enterprise applications typically have horizontal air flow. 
The small-medium AdvancedTCA shelves are targeted to the telecommunication market; for the lab research operation, some shelves have an open cover in order to make testing easier. 
Backplane architecture
The AdvancedTCA backplane provides point-to-point connections between the boards and does not use a data bus. The backplane definition is divided into three sections; Zone-1, Zone-2, and Zone-3. The connectors in Zone-1 provide redundant −48 VDC power and Shelf Management signals to the boards. The connectors in Zone-2 provide the connections to the Base Interface and Fabric Interface. All Fabric connections use point-to-point 100 Ω differential signals. Zone-2 is called "Fabric Agnostic" which means that any Fabric that can use 100 Ω differential signals can be used with an AdvancedTCA backplane.[4] 
The connectors in Zone-3 are user defined and are usually used to connect a front board to a Rear Transition Module. The Zone-3 area can also hold a special backplane to interconnect boards with signals that are not defined in the AdvancedTCA specification. 
The AdvancedTCA Fabric specification uses Logical Slots to describe the interconnections. The Fabric Switch Boards go in Logical Slots 1 and 2. The chassis manufacturer is free to decide the relationship between Logical and Physical Slots in a chassis. The chassis Field Replaceable Units (FRU) data includes an Address Table that describes the relationship between the Logical and Physical slots. 
The Shelf Managers communicate with each board and FRU in the chassis with IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) protocols running on redundant I²C buses on the Zone-1 connectors. 
The Base Interface is the primary Fabric on the Zone-2 connectors and allocates 4 differential pairs per Base Channel. It is wired as a Dual-Star with redundant fabric hub slots at the core. It is commonly used for out of band management, firmware uploading, OS boot, etc. 
The Fabric Interface on the backplane supports many different Fabrics and can be wired as a Dual-Star, Dual-Dual-Star, Mesh, Replicated-Mesh or other architectures. It allocates 8 differential pairs per Fabric Channel and each Channel can be divided into four 2-pair Ports. The Fabric Interface is typically used to move data between the boards and the outside network. 
The Synchronization Clock Interface routes MLVDS (Multipoint Low-voltage differential signaling) clock signals over multiple 130 Ω buses. The clocks are typically used to synchronize telecom interfaces. 
Update Channel Interface is a set of 10 differential signal pairs that interconnect two slots. Which slots are interconnected depends on the particular backplane design. These are signals commonly used to interconnect two hub boards, or redundant processor boards. 
Fabrics
The Base Interface can only be 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, or 1000BASE-T Ethernet. Since all boards and hubs are required to support one of these interfaces there is always a network connection to the boards. 
The Fabric is commonly SerDes Gigabit Ethernet, but can also be Fibre Channel, XAUI 10-Gigabit Ethernet, InfiniBand, PCI Express, or Serial RapidIO. Any Fabric that can use the point-to-point 100 Ω differential signals can be used with an AdvancedTCA backplane. 
The PICMG 3.1 Ethernet/Fibre Channel specification has been revised to include IEEE 100GBASE-KR4 signaling to the existing IEEE 40GBASE-KR4, 10GBASE-KX4, 10GBASE-KR, and XAUI signaling. 
Blades (boards)
AdvancedTCA blades can be Processors, Switches, AMC carriers, etc. A typical shelf will contain one or more switch blades and several processor blades. 
When they are first inserted into the shelf the onboard IPMC is powered from the redundant −48 V on the backplane. The IPMC sends an IPMI event message to the Shelf Manager to let it know that it has been installed. The Shelf Manager reads information from the blade and determines if there is enough power available. If there is, the Shelf Manager sends a command to the IPMC to power-up the payload part of the blade. The Shelf Manager also determines what fabric ports are supported by the blade. It then looks at the fabric interconnect information for the backplane to find out what fabric ports are on the other end of the fabric connections. If the fabric ports on both ends of the backplane wires match then it sends an IPMI command to both blades to enable the matching ports. 
Once the blade is powered-up and connected to the fabrics the Shelf Manager listens for event messages from the sensors on the blade. If a temperature sensor reports that it is too warm then the Shelf Manager will increase the speed of the fans. 
The FRU data in the board contains descriptive information like the manufacturer, model number, serial number, manufacturing date, revision, etc. This information can be read remotely to perform an inventory of the blades in a shelf. 
Shelf Management
 AdvancedTCA Shelf manager 
The Shelf Manager monitors and controls the boards (blades) and FRU in the shelf. If any sensor reports a problem the Shelf Manager can take action or report the problem to a System Manager. This action could be something simple like making the fans go faster, or more drastic such as powering off a board. Each board and FRU contains inventory information (FRU Data) that can be retrieved by the Shelf Manager. The FRU data is used by the Shelf Manager to determine if there is enough power available for a board or FRU and if the Fabric ports that interconnect boards are compatible. The FRU data can also reveal the manufacturer, manufacturing date, model number, serial number, and asset tag. 
Each blade, intelligent FRU, and Shelf Manager contains an Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC). The Shelf Manager communicates with the boards and intelligent FRUs with IPMI protocols running on redundant I²C buses. IPMI protocols include packet checksums to ensure that data transmission is reliable. It is also possible to have non-intelligent FRUs managed by an intelligent FRUs. These are called Managed FRUs and have the same capabilities as an intelligent FRU. 
The interconnection between the Shelf Manager and the boards is a redundant pair of Intelligent Platform Management Buses (IPMBs). The IPMB architecture can be a pair of buses (Bused IPMB) or a pair of radial connections (Radial IPMB). Radial IPMB implementations usually include the capability to isolate individual IPMB connections to improve reliability in the event of an IPMC failure. 
The Shelf Manager communicates with outside entities with RMCP (IPMI over TCP/IP), HTTP, SNMP over an Ethernet network. Some Shelf Managers support the Hardware Platform Interface, a technical specification defined by the Service Availability Forum. 
New specification activity
Two new working groups have been started to adapt ATCA to the specific requirements of physics research. 
	WG1: Physics xTCA I/O, Timing and Synchronization Working Group
WG1 will define rear I/O for AMC modules and a new component called the μRTM. Additions will be made to the μTCA Shelf specification to accommodate the μRTM and to the ATCA specification to accommodate AMC Rear I/O for an ATCA carrier RTM. Signal lines be identified for use as clocks, gates, and triggers that are commonly used in Physics data acquisition systems. 
	WG2: Physics xTCA Software Architectures and Protocols Working Group
WG2 will define a common set of software architectures and supporting infrastructure to facilitate inter-operability and portability of both hardware and software modules among the various applications developed for the Physics xTCA platform and that will minimize the development effort and time required to construct experiments and systems using that platform. 
A working group was formed to extend ATCA to non-telecom markets. 
	PICMG 3.7 ATCA Extensions for Applications Outside the Telecom Central Office
The goals of this new working group are to define enhanced features to support double-wide boards; add enhancements to support 600W single-slot boards and 800W double-slot boards; add support for double-sided shelves with full sized boards plugged into both the front and rear of the shelf; and add support for 10Gbs signaling on the Base Interface. 
PICMG specifications
	3.0 is the "base" or "core" specification. The AdvancedTCA definition alone defines a Fabric agnostic chassis backplane that can be used with any of the Fabrics defined in the following specifications:
	3.1 Ethernet (and Fibre Channel)
	3.2 InfiniBand
	3.3 StarFabric
	3.4 PCI Express (and PCI Express Advanced Switching)
	3.5 RapidIO

Wireless communication (or just wireless, when the context allows) is the transfer of information (telecommunication) between two or more points without the use of an electrical conductor, optical fiber or other continuous guided medium for the transfer. The most common wireless technologies use radio waves. With radio waves, intended distances can be short, such as a few meters for Bluetooth, or as far as millions of kilometers for deep-space radio communications. It encompasses various types of fixed, mobile, and portable applications, including two-way radios, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and wireless networking. Other examples of applications of radio wireless technology include GPS units, garage door openers, wireless computer mouse, keyboards and headsets, headphones, radio receivers, satellite television, broadcast television and cordless telephones. Somewhat less common methods of achieving wireless communications involve other electromagnetic phenomena, such as light and magnetic or electric fields, or the use of sound. 
The term wireless has been used twice in communications history, with slightly different meanings. It was initially used from about 1890 for the first radio transmitting and receiving technology, as in wireless telegraphy, until the new word radio replaced it around 1920. Radio sets in the UK and the English-speaking world that were not portable continued to be referred to as wireless sets into the 1960s.[1][2] The term wireless was revived in the 1980s and 1990s mainly to distinguish digital devices that communicate without wires, such as the examples listed in the previous paragraph, from those that require wires or cables. This became its primary usage in the 2000s, due to the advent of technologies such as mobile broadband, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. 
Wireless operations permit services, such as mobile and interplanetary communications, that are impossible or impractical to implement with the use of wires. The term is commonly used in the telecommunications industry to refer to telecommunications systems (e.g. radio transmitters and receivers, remote controls, etc.) that use some form of energy (e.g. radio waves and acoustic energy) to transfer information without the use of wires.[3][4][5] Information is transferred in this manner over both short and long distances.

Photophone

 Bell and Tainter's photophone, of 1880. 
The first wireless telephone conversation occurred in 1880 when Alexander Graham Bell and Charles Sumner Tainter invented the photophone, a telephone that sent audio over a beam of light. The photophone required sunlight to operate, and a clear line of sight between the transmitter and receiver, which greatly decreased the viability of the photophone in any practical use.[6] It would be several decades before the photophone's principles found their first practical applications in military communications and later in fiber-optic communications. 
Electric wireless technology
Early wireless
Main article: Wireless telegraphy
A number of wireless electrical signaling schemes including sending electric currents through water and the ground using electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were investigated for telegraphy in the late 19th century before practical radio systems became available. These included a patented induction system by Thomas Edison allowing a telegraph on a running train to connect with telegraph wires running parallel to the tracks, a William Preece induction telegraph system for sending messages across bodies of water, and several operational and proposed telegraphy and voice earth conduction systems. 
The Edison system was used by stranded trains during the Great Blizzard of 1888 and earth conductive systems found limited use between trenches during World War I but these systems were never successful economically. 
Radio waves
Main article: History of radio
 Marconi transmitting the first radio signal across the Atlantic. 
In 1894, Guglielmo Marconi began developing a wireless telegraph system using radio waves, which had been known about since proof of their existence in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz, but discounted as a communication format since they seemed, at the time, to be a short-range phenomenon.[7] Marconi soon developed a system that was transmitting signals way beyond distances anyone could have predicted (due in part to the signals bouncing off the then unknown ionosphere). Marconi and Karl Ferdinand Braun were awarded the 1909 Nobel Prize for Physics for their contribution to this form of wireless telegraphy. 
Millimetre wave communication was first investigated by Jagadish Chandra Bose during 1894–1896, when he reached an extremely high frequency of up to 60 GHz in his experiments.[8] He also introduced the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio waves,[9] when he patented the radio crystal detector in 1901.[10][11] 
Wireless revolution
 Power MOSFETs, which are used in RF power amplifiers to boost radio frequency (RF) signals in long-distance wireless networks. 
The wireless revolution began in the 1990s,[12][13][14] with the advent of digital wireless networks leading to a social revolution, and a paradigm shift from wired to wireless technology,[15] including the proliferation of commercial wireless technologies such as cell phones, mobile telephony, pagers, wireless computer networks,[12] cellular networks, the wireless Internet, and laptop and handheld computers with wireless connections.[16] The wireless revolution has been driven by advances in radio frequency (RF), microelectronics, and microwave engineering,[12] and the transition from analog to digital RF technology,[15][16] which enabled a substantial increase in voice traffic along with the delivery of digital data such as text messaging, images and streaming media.[15]

Further information: Microwave transmission
Radio and microwave communication carry information by modulating properties of electromagnetic waves transmitted through space. Specifically, the transmitter generates artificial electromagnetic waves by applying time-varying electric currents to its antenna. The waves travel away from the antenna until they eventually reach the antenna of a receiver, which induces an electric current in the receiving antenna. This current can be detected and demodulated to recreate the information sent by the transmitter. 
Free-space optical
Main article: Free-space optical communication
 An 8-beam free space optics laser link, rated for 1 Gbit/s at a distance of approximately 2 km. The receptor is the large disc in the middle, and the transmitters are the smaller ones. To the top and right corner is a monocular for assisting the alignment of the two heads.
Free-space optical communication (FSO) is an optical communication technology that uses light propagating in free space to transmit wireless data for telecommunications or computer networking. "Free space" means the light beams travel through the open air or outer space. This contrasts with other communication technologies that use light beams traveling through transmission lines such as optical fiber or dielectric "light pipes". 
The technology is useful where physical connections are impractical due to high costs or other considerations. For example, free space optical links are used in cities between office buildings that are not wired for networking, where the cost of running cable through the building and under the street would be prohibitive. Another widely used example is consumer IR devices such as remote controls and IrDA (Infrared Data Association) networking, which is used as an alternative to WiFi networking to allow laptops, PDAs, printers, and digital cameras to exchange data. 
Sonic
Sonic, especially ultrasonic short-range communication involves the transmission and reception of sound. 
Electromagnetic induction
Electromagnetic induction only allows short-range communication and power transmission. It has been used in biomedical situations such as pacemakers, as well as for short-range RFID tags. 
Services
Common examples of wireless equipment include:[17] 
	Infrared and ultrasonic remote control devices
	Professional LMR (Land Mobile Radio) and SMR (Specialized Mobile Radio) are typically used by business, industrial, and Public Safety entities.
	Consumer Two-way radio including FRS Family Radio Service, GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service), and Citizens band ("CB") radios.
	The Amateur Radio Service (Ham radio).
	Consumer and professional Marine VHF radios.
	Airband and radio navigation equipment used by aviators and air traffic control
	Cellular telephones and pagers: provide connectivity for portable and mobile applications, both personal and business.
	Global Positioning System (GPS): allows drivers of cars and trucks, captains of boats and ships, and pilots of aircraft to ascertain their location anywhere on earth.[18]
	Cordless computer peripherals: the cordless mouse is a common example; wireless headphones, keyboards, and printers can also be linked to a computer via wireless using technology such as Wireless USB or Bluetooth.
	Cordless telephone sets: these are limited-range devices, not to be confused with cell phones.
	Satellite television: Is broadcast from satellites in geostationary orbit. Typical services use direct broadcast satellite to provide multiple television channels to viewers.
Electromagnetic spectrum
See also: Spectrum management
AM and FM radios and other electronic devices make use of the electromagnetic spectrum. The frequencies of the radio spectrum that are available for use for communication are treated as a public resource and are regulated by organizations such as the American Federal Communications Commission, Ofcom in the United Kingdom, the international ITU-R or the European ETSI. Their regulations determine which frequency ranges can be used for what purpose and by whom. In the absence of such control or alternative arrangements such as a privatized electromagnetic spectrum, chaos might result if, for example, airlines did not have specific frequencies to work under and an amateur radio operator was interfering with a pilot's ability to land an aircraft. Wireless communication spans the spectrum from 9 kHz to 300 GHz.[citation needed] 
Applications
Mobile telephones
One of the best-known examples of wireless technology is the mobile phone, also known as a cellular phone, with more than 6.6 billion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide as of the end of 2010.[19] These wireless phones use radio waves from signal-transmission towers to enable their users to make phone calls from many locations worldwide. They can be used within the range of the mobile telephone site used to house the equipment required to transmit and receive the radio signals from these instruments.[20]

Wireless data communications allow wireless networking between desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers, cell phones, and other related devices. The various available technologies differ in local availability, coverage range, and performance,[21] and in some circumstances, users employ multiple connection types and switch between them using connection manager software[22][23] or a mobile VPN to handle the multiple connections as a secure, single virtual network.[24] Supporting technologies include: 
Wi-Fi is a wireless local area network that enables portable computing devices to connect easily with other devices, peripherals, and the Internet.[citation needed] Standardized as IEEE 802.11 a, b, g, n, ac, ax, Wi-Fi has link speeds similar to older standards of wired Ethernet. Wi-Fi has become the de facto standard for access in private homes, within offices, and at public hotspots.[25] Some businesses charge customers a monthly fee for service, while others have begun offering it free in an effort to increase the sales of their goods.[26]
Cellular data service offers coverage within a range of 10-15 miles from the nearest cell site.[21] Speeds have increased as technologies have evolved, from earlier technologies such as GSM, CDMA and GPRS, through 3G, to 4G networks such as W-CDMA, EDGE or CDMA2000.[27][28] As of 2018, the proposed next generation is 5G.
Low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) bridge the gap between Wi-Fi and Cellular for low-bitrate Internet of things (IoT) applications.
Mobile-satellite communications may be used where other wireless connections are unavailable, such as in largely rural areas[29] or remote locations.[21] Satellite communications are especially important for transportation, aviation, maritime and military use.[30]
Wireless sensor networks are responsible for sensing noise, interference, and activity in data collection networks. This allows us to detect relevant quantities, monitor and collect data, formulate clear user displays, and to perform decision-making functions[31]
Wireless data communications are used to span a distance beyond the capabilities of typical cabling in point-to-point communication and point-to-multipoint communication, to provide a backup communications link in case of normal network failure, to link portable or temporary workstations, to overcome situations where normal cabling is difficult or financially impractical, or to remotely connect mobile users or networks. 
Peripherals
Peripheral devices in computing can also be connected wirelessly, as part of a Wi-Fi network or directly via an optical or radio-frequency (RF) peripheral interface. Originally these units used bulky, highly local transceivers to mediate between a computer and a keyboard and mouse; however, more recent generations have used smaller, higher-performance devices. Radio-frequency interfaces, such as Bluetooth or Wireless USB, provide greater ranges of efficient use, usually up to 10 feet, but distance, physical obstacles, competing signals, and even human bodies can all degrade the signal quality.[32] Concerns about the security of wireless keyboards arose at the end of 2007 when it was revealed that Microsoft's implementation of encryption in some of its 27 MHz models were highly insecure.[33] 
Energy transfer
Main article: Wireless energy transfer
Wireless energy transfer is a process whereby electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load that does not have a built-in power source, without the use of interconnecting wires. There are two different fundamental methods for wireless energy transfer. Energy can be transferred using either far-field methods that involve beaming power/lasers, radio or microwave transmissions, or near-field using electromagnetic induction.[34] Wireless energy transfer may be combined with wireless information transmission in what is known as Wireless Powered Communication.[35] In 2015, researchers at the University of Washington demonstrated far-field energy transfer using Wi-Fi signals to power cameras.[36] 
Medical technologies
New wireless technologies, such as mobile body area networks (MBAN), have the capability to monitor blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen level, and body temperature. The MBAN works by sending low-powered wireless signals to receivers that feed into nursing stations or monitoring sites. This technology helps with the intentional and unintentional risk of infection or disconnection that arise from wired connections.[37]

In machine learning, a neural network (also artificial neural network or neural net, abbreviated ANN or NN) is a model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in animal brains.[1][2] 
An ANN consists of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in the brain. These are connected by edges, which model the synapses in the brain. Each artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons. The "signal" is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs, called the activation function. The strength of the signal at each connection is determined by a weight, which adjusts during the learning process. 
Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly passing through multiple intermediate layers (hidden layers). A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least two hidden layers.[3] 
Artificial neural networks are used for various tasks, including predictive modeling, adaptive control, and solving problems in artificial intelligence. They can learn from experience, and can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information. 
Training
Neural networks are typically trained through empirical risk minimization. This method is based on the idea of optimizing the network's parameters to minimize the difference, or empirical risk, between the predicted output and the actual target values in a given dataset.[4] Gradient-based methods such as backpropagation are usually used to estimate the parameters of the network.[4] During the training phase, ANNs learn from labeled training data by iteratively updating their parameters to minimize a defined loss function.[5] This method allows the network to generalize to unseen data.
 
Simplified example of training a neural network in object detection: The network is trained by multiple images that are known to depict starfish and sea urchins, which are correlated with "nodes" that represent visual features. The starfish match with a ringed texture and a star outline, whereas most sea urchins match with a striped texture and oval shape. However, the instance of a ring textured sea urchin creates a weakly weighted association between them.
 
Subsequent run of the network on an input image (left):[6] The network correctly detects the starfish. However, the weakly weighted association between ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter from one of two intermediate nodes. In addition, a shell that was not included in the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape, also resulting in a weak signal for the sea urchin output. These weak signals may result in a false positive result for sea urchin.
In reality, textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes, but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes.
History
Main article: History of artificial neural networks
Early work
Today's deep neural networks are based on early work in statistics over 200 years ago. The simplest kind of feedforward neural network (FNN) is a linear network, which consists of a single layer of output nodes with linear activation functions; the inputs are fed directly to the outputs via a series of weights. The sum of the products of the weights and the inputs is calculated at each node. The mean squared errors between these calculated outputs and the given target values are minimized by creating an adjustment to the weights. This technique has been known for over two centuries as the method of least squares or linear regression. It was used as a means of finding a good rough linear fit to a set of points by Legendre (1805) and Gauss (1795) for the prediction of planetary movement.[7][8][9][10][11] 
Historically, digital computers such as the von Neumann model operate via the execution of explicit instructions with access to memory by a number of processors. Some neural networks, on the other hand, originated from efforts to model information processing in biological systems through the framework of connectionism. Unlike the von Neumann model, connectionist computing does not separate memory and processing. 
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts[12] (1943) considered a non-learning computational model for neural networks.[13] This model paved the way for research to split into two approaches. One approach focused on biological processes while the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence. 
In the late 1940s, D. O. Hebb[14] proposed a learning hypothesis based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that became known as Hebbian learning. It was used in many early neural networks, such as Rosenblatt's perceptron and the Hopfield network. Farley and Clark[15] (1954) used computational machines to simulate a Hebbian network. Other neural network computational machines were created by Rochester, Holland, Habit and Duda (1956).[16] 
In 1958, psychologist Frank Rosenblatt described the perceptron, one of the first implemented artificial neural networks,[17][18][19][20] funded by the United States Office of Naval Research.[21] R. D. Joseph (1960)[22] mentions an even earlier perceptron-like device by Farley and Clark:[10] "Farley and Clark of MIT Lincoln Laboratory actually preceded Rosenblatt in the development of a perceptron-like device." However, "they dropped the subject." The perceptron raised public excitement for research in Artificial Neural Networks, causing the US government to drastically increase funding. This contributed to "the Golden Age of AI" fueled by the optimistic claims made by computer scientists regarding the ability of perceptrons to emulate human intelligence.[23] 
The first perceptrons did not have adaptive hidden units. However, Joseph (1960)[22] also discussed multilayer perceptrons with an adaptive hidden layer. Rosenblatt (1962)[24]: section 16  cited and adopted these ideas, also crediting work by H. D. Block and B. W. Knight. Unfortunately, these early efforts did not lead to a working learning algorithm for hidden units, i.e., deep learning. 
Deep learning breakthroughs in the 1960s and 1970s
Fundamental research was conducted on ANNs in the 1960s and 1970s. The first working deep learning algorithm was the Group method of data handling, a method to train arbitrarily deep neural networks, published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in Ukraine (1965). They regarded it as a form of polynomial regression,[25] or a generalization of Rosenblatt's perceptron.[26] A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by this method,[27] which is based on layer by layer training through regression analysis. Superfluous hidden units are pruned using a separate validation set. Since the activation functions of the nodes are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials, these were also the first deep networks with multiplicative units or "gates."[10] 
The first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent[28] was published in 1967 by Shun'ichi Amari.[29] In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes.[10] Subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique. 
In 1969, Kunihiko Fukushima introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function.[10][30][31] The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for deep learning.[32] 
Nevertheless, research stagnated in the United States following the work of Minsky and Papert (1969),[33] who emphasized that basic perceptrons were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. This insight was irrelevant for the deep networks of Ivakhnenko (1965) and Amari (1967). 
In 1976 transfer learning was introduced in neural networks learning. [34] [35] 
Deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers and weight replication began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, though not trained by backpropagation.[36][37][38] 
Backpropagation
Backpropagation is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673[39] to networks of differentiable nodes. The terminology "back-propagating errors" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt,[24] but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context of control theory.[40] In 1970, Seppo Linnainmaa published the modern form of backpropagation in his master thesis (1970).[41][42][10] G.M. Ostrovski et al. republished it in 1971.[43][44] Paul Werbos applied backpropagation to neural networks in 1982[45][46] (his 1974 PhD thesis, reprinted in a 1994 book,[47] did not yet describe the algorithm[44]). In 1986, David E. Rumelhart et al. popularised backpropagation but did not cite the original work.[48] 
Convolutional neural networks
Kunihiko Fukushima's convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture of 1979[36] also introduced max pooling,[49] a popular downsampling procedure for CNNs. CNNs have become an essential tool for computer vision. 
The time delay neural network (TDNN) was introduced in 1987 by Alex Waibel to apply CNN to phoneme recognition. It used convolutions, weight sharing, and backpropagation.[50][51] In 1988, Wei Zhang applied a backpropagation-trained CNN to alphabet recognition.[52] In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. created a CNN called LeNet for recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. Training required 3 days.[53] In 1990, Wei Zhang implemented a CNN on optical computing hardware.[54] In 1991, a CNN was applied to medical image object segmentation[55] and breast cancer detection in mammograms.[56] LeNet-5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in 32×32 pixel images.[57] 
From 1988 onward,[58][59] the use of neural networks transformed the field of protein structure prediction, in particular when the first cascading networks were trained on profiles (matrices) produced by multiple sequence alignments.[60] 
Recurrent neural networks
One origin of RNN was statistical mechanics. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari proposed to modify the weights of an Ising model by Hebbian learning rule as a model of associative memory, adding in the component of learning.[61] This was popularized as the Hopfield network by John Hopfield(1982).[62] Another origin of RNN was neuroscience. The word "recurrent" is used to describe loop-like structures in anatomy. In 1901, Cajal observed "recurrent semicircles" in the cerebellar cortex.[63] Hebb considered "reverberating circuit" as an explanation for short-term memory.[64] The McCulloch and Pitts paper (1943) considered neural networks that contains cycles, and noted that the current activity of such networks can be affected by activity indefinitely far in the past.[12] 
In 1982 a recurrent neural network, with an array architecture (rather than a multilayer perceptron architecture), named Crossbar Adaptive Array [65][66] used direct recurrent connections from the output to the supervisor (teaching ) inputs. In addition of computing actions (decisions), it computed internal state evaluations (emotions) of the consequence situations. Eliminating the external supervisor, it introduced the self-learning method in neural networks. 
In cognitive psychology, the journal American Psychologist in early 1980's carried out a debate on relation between cognition and emotion. Zajonc in 1980 stated that emotion is computed first and is independent from cognition, while Lazarus in 1982 stated that cognition is computed first and is inseparable from emotion. [67][68] In 1982 the Crossbar Adaptive Array gave a neural network model of cognition-emotion relation. [65][69] It was an example of a debate where an AI system, a recurrent neural network, contributed to an issue in the same time addressed by cognitive psychology. 
Two early influential works were the Jordan network (1986) and the Elman network (1990), which applied RNN to study cognitive psychology. 
In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep RNNs. To overcome this problem, in 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber proposed the "neural sequence chunker" or "neural history compressor"[70][71] which introduced the important concepts of self-supervised pre-training (the "P" in ChatGPT) and neural knowledge distillation.[10] In 1993, a neural history compressor system solved a "Very Deep Learning" task that required more than 1000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time.[72] 
In 1991, Sepp Hochreiter's diploma thesis [73] identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem[73][74] and proposed recurrent residual connections to solve it. He and Schmidhuber introduced long short-term memory (LSTM), which set accuracy records in multiple applications domains.[75][76] This was not yet the modern version of LSTM, which required the forget gate, which was introduced in 1999.[77] It became the default choice for RNN architecture. 
During 1985–1995, inspired by statistical mechanics, several architectures and methods were developed by Terry Sejnowski, Peter Dayan, Geoffrey Hinton, etc., including the Boltzmann machine,[78] restricted Boltzmann machine,[79] Helmholtz machine,[80] and the wake-sleep algorithm.[81] These were designed for unsupervised learning of deep generative models. 
Deep learning
Between 2009 and 2012, ANNs began winning prizes in image recognition contests, approaching human level performance on various tasks, initially in pattern recognition and handwriting recognition.[82][83] In 2011, a CNN named DanNet[84][85] by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Luca Maria Gambardella, and Jürgen Schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3.[38] It then won more contests.[86][87] They also showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU improved performance significantly.[88] 
In October 2012, AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton[89] won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. Further incremental improvements included the VGG-16 network by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman[90] and Google's Inceptionv3.[91] 
In 2012, Ng and Dean created a network that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images.[92] Unsupervised pre-training and increased computing power from GPUs and distributed computing allowed the use of larger networks, particularly in image and visual recognition problems, which became known as "deep learning".[5] 
Radial basis function and wavelet networks were introduced in 2013. These can be shown to offer best approximation properties and have been applied in nonlinear system identification and classification applications.[93] 
Generative adversarial network (GAN) (Ian Goodfellow et al., 2014)[94] became state of the art in generative modeling during 2014–2018 period. The GAN principle was originally published in 1991 by Jürgen Schmidhuber who called it "artificial curiosity": two neural networks contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game, where one network's gain is the other network's loss.[95][96] The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. Excellent image quality is achieved by Nvidia's StyleGAN (2018)[97] based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al.[98] Here, the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion. Image generation by GAN reached popular success, and provoked discussions concerning deepfakes.[99] Diffusion models (2015)[100] eclipsed GANs in generative modeling since then, with systems such as DALL•E 2 (2022) and Stable Diffusion (2022). 
In 2014, the state of the art was training "very deep neural network" with 20 to 30 layers.[101] Stacking too many layers led to a steep reduction in training accuracy,[102] known as the "degradation" problem.[103] In 2015, two techniques were developed to train very deep networks: the highway network was published in May 2015,[104] and the residual neural network (ResNet) in December 2015.[105][106] ResNet behaves like an open-gated Highway Net. 
Main article: Transformer (deep learning architecture) § History
During the 2010s, the seq2seq model was developed, and attention mechanisms were added. It led to the modern Transformer architecture in 2017 in Attention Is All You Need.[107] It requires computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. Jürgen Schmidhuber's fast weight controller (1992)[108] scales linearly and was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.[109][110][10] Transformers have increasingly become the model of choice for natural language processing.[111] Many modern large language models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and BERT use this architecture.

 Neuron and myelinated axon, with signal flow from inputs at dendrites to outputs at axon terminals 
ANNs began as an attempt to exploit the architecture of the human brain to perform tasks that conventional algorithms had little success with. They soon reoriented towards improving empirical results, abandoning attempts to remain true to their biological precursors. ANNs have the ability to learn and model non-linearities and complex relationships. This is achieved by neurons being connected in various patterns, allowing the output of some neurons to become the input of others. The network forms a directed, weighted graph.[112] 
An artificial neural network consists of simulated neurons. Each neuron is connected to other nodes via links like a biological axon-synapse-dendrite connection. All the nodes connected by links take in some data and use it to perform specific operations and tasks on the data. Each link has a weight, determining the strength of one node's influence on another,[113] allowing weights to choose the signal between neurons. 
Artificial neurons
ANNs are composed of artificial neurons which are conceptually derived from biological neurons. Each artificial neuron has inputs and produces a single output which can be sent to multiple other neurons.[114] The inputs can be the feature values of a sample of external data, such as images or documents, or they can be the outputs of other neurons. The outputs of the final output neurons of the neural net accomplish the task, such as recognizing an object in an image.[citation needed] 
To find the output of the neuron we take the weighted sum of all the inputs, weighted by the weights of the connections from the inputs to the neuron. We add a bias term to this sum.[115] This weighted sum is sometimes called the activation. This weighted sum is then passed through a (usually nonlinear) activation function to produce the output. The initial inputs are external data, such as images and documents. The ultimate outputs accomplish the task, such as recognizing an object in an image.[116] 
Organization
The neurons are typically organized into multiple layers, especially in deep learning. Neurons of one layer connect only to neurons of the immediately preceding and immediately following layers. The layer that receives external data is the input layer. The layer that produces the ultimate result is the output layer. In between them are zero or more hidden layers. Single layer and unlayered networks are also used. Between two layers, multiple connection patterns are possible. They can be 'fully connected', with every neuron in one layer connecting to every neuron in the next layer. They can be pooling, where a group of neurons in one layer connects to a single neuron in the next layer, thereby reducing the number of neurons in that layer.[117] Neurons with only such connections form a directed acyclic graph and are known as feedforward networks.[118] Alternatively, networks that allow connections between neurons in the same or previous layers are known as recurrent networks.[119] 
Hyperparameter
Main article: Hyperparameter (machine learning)
A hyperparameter is a constant parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. The values of parameters are derived via learning. Examples of hyperparameters include learning rate, the number of hidden layers and batch size.[citation needed] The values of some hyperparameters can be dependent on those of other hyperparameters. For example, the size of some layers can depend on the overall number of layers.[citation needed]

Learning is the adaptation of the network to better handle a task by considering sample observations. Learning involves adjusting the weights (and optional thresholds) of the network to improve the accuracy of the result. This is done by minimizing the observed errors. Learning is complete when examining additional observations does not usefully reduce the error rate. Even after learning, the error rate typically does not reach 0. If after learning, the error rate is too high, the network typically must be redesigned. Practically this is done by defining a cost function that is evaluated periodically during learning. As long as its output continues to decline, learning continues. The cost is frequently defined as a statistic whose value can only be approximated. The outputs are actually numbers, so when the error is low, the difference between the output (almost certainly a cat) and the correct answer (cat) is small. Learning attempts to reduce the total of the differences across the observations. Most learning models can be viewed as a straightforward application of optimization theory and statistical estimation.[112][120] 
Learning rate
Main article: Learning rate
The learning rate defines the size of the corrective steps that the model takes to adjust for errors in each observation.[121] A high learning rate shortens the training time, but with lower ultimate accuracy, while a lower learning rate takes longer, but with the potential for greater accuracy. Optimizations such as Quickprop are primarily aimed at speeding up error minimization, while other improvements mainly try to increase reliability. In order to avoid oscillation inside the network such as alternating connection weights, and to improve the rate of convergence, refinements use an adaptive learning rate that increases or decreases as appropriate.[122] The concept of momentum allows the balance between the gradient and the previous change to be weighted such that the weight adjustment depends to some degree on the previous change. A momentum close to 0 emphasizes the gradient, while a value close to 1 emphasizes the last change.[citation needed] 
Cost function
While it is possible to define a cost function ad hoc, frequently the choice is determined by the function's desirable properties (such as convexity) or because it arises from the model (e.g. in a probabilistic model the model's posterior probability can be used as an inverse cost).[citation needed] 
Backpropagation
Main article: Backpropagation
Backpropagation is a method used to adjust the connection weights to compensate for each error found during learning. The error amount is effectively divided among the connections. Technically, backprop calculates the gradient (the derivative) of the cost function associated with a given state with respect to the weights. The weight updates can be done via stochastic gradient descent or other methods, such as extreme learning machines,[123] "no-prop" networks,[124] training without backtracking,[125] "weightless" networks,[126][127] and non-connectionist neural networks.[citation needed] 
Learning paradigms
 	This section includes a list of references, related reading, or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations. Please help improve this section by introducing more precise citations. (August 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this message)

Machine learning is commonly separated into three main learning paradigms, supervised learning,[128] unsupervised learning[129] and reinforcement learning.[130] Each corresponds to a particular learning task. 
Supervised learning
Supervised learning uses a set of paired inputs and desired outputs. The learning task is to produce the desired output for each input. In this case, the cost function is related to eliminating incorrect deductions.[131] A commonly used cost is the mean-squared error, which tries to minimize the average squared error between the network's output and the desired output. Tasks suited for supervised learning are pattern recognition (also known as classification) and regression (also known as function approximation). Supervised learning is also applicable to sequential data (e.g., for handwriting, speech and gesture recognition). This can be thought of as learning with a "teacher", in the form of a function that provides continuous feedback on the quality of solutions obtained thus far. 
Unsupervised learning
In unsupervised learning, input data is given along with the cost function, some function of the data  and the network's output. The cost function is dependent on the task (the model domain) and any a priori assumptions (the implicit properties of the model, its parameters and the observed variables). As a trivial example, consider the model  where  is a constant and the cost  . Minimizing this cost produces a value of  that is equal to the mean of the data. The cost function can be much more complicated. Its form depends on the application: for example, in compression it could be related to the mutual information between  and  , whereas in statistical modeling, it could be related to the posterior probability of the model given the data (note that in both of those examples, those quantities would be maximized rather than minimized). Tasks that fall within the paradigm of unsupervised learning are in general estimation problems; the applications include clustering, the estimation of statistical distributions, compression and filtering. 
Reinforcement learning
Main article: Reinforcement learning
See also: Stochastic control
In applications such as playing video games, an actor takes a string of actions, receiving a generally unpredictable response from the environment after each one. The goal is to win the game, i.e., generate the most positive (lowest cost) responses. In reinforcement learning, the aim is to weight the network (devise a policy) to perform actions that minimize long-term (expected cumulative) cost. At each point in time the agent performs an action and the environment generates an observation and an instantaneous cost, according to some (usually unknown) rules. The rules and the long-term cost usually only can be estimated. At any juncture, the agent decides whether to explore new actions to uncover their costs or to exploit prior learning to proceed more quickly. 
Formally the environment is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) with states  and actions  . Because the state transitions are not known, probability distributions are used instead: the instantaneous cost distribution  , the observation distribution  and the transition distribution  , while a policy is defined as the conditional distribution over actions given the observations. Taken together, the two define a Markov chain (MC). The aim is to discover the lowest-cost MC. 
ANNs serve as the learning component in such applications.[132][133] Dynamic programming coupled with ANNs (giving neurodynamic programming)[134] has been applied to problems such as those involved in vehicle routing,[135] video games, natural resource management[136][137] and medicine[138] because of ANNs ability to mitigate losses of accuracy even when reducing the discretization grid density for numerically approximating the solution of control problems. Tasks that fall within the paradigm of reinforcement learning are control problems, games and other sequential decision making tasks. 
Self-learning
Self-learning in neural networks was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning named crossbar adaptive array (CAA).[139] It is a system with only one input, situation s, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. It has neither external advice input nor external reinforcement input from the environment. The CAA computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about encountered situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.[140] Given the memory matrix, W =||w(a,s)||, the crossbar self-learning algorithm in each iteration performs the following computation: 
 In situation s perform action a;
 Receive consequence situation s';
 Compute emotion of being in consequence situation v(s');
 Update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s').
The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is genetic environment, where from it initially and only once receives initial emotions about to be encountered situations in the behavioral environment. Having received the genome vector (species vector) from the genetic environment, the CAA will learn a goal-seeking behavior, in the behavioral environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.[141] 
Neuroevolution
Main article: Neuroevolution
Neuroevolution can create neural network topologies and weights using evolutionary computation. It is competitive with sophisticated gradient descent approaches.[142][143] One advantage of neuroevolution is that it may be less prone to get caught in "dead ends".[144] 
Stochastic neural network
Stochastic neural networks originating from Sherrington–Kirkpatrick models are a type of artificial neural network built by introducing random variations into the network, either by giving the network's artificial neurons stochastic transfer functions [citation needed], or by giving them stochastic weights. This makes them useful tools for optimization problems, since the random fluctuations help the network escape from local minima.[145] Stochastic neural networks trained using a Bayesian approach are known as Bayesian neural networks.[146] 
Other
In a Bayesian framework, a distribution over the set of allowed models is chosen to minimize the cost. Evolutionary methods,[147] gene expression programming,[148] simulated annealing,[149] expectation–maximization, non-parametric methods and particle swarm optimization[150] are other learning algorithms. Convergent recursion is a learning algorithm for cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural networks.[151][152] 
Modes
 	This section includes a list of references, related reading, or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations. Please help improve this section by introducing more precise citations. (August 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this message)

Two modes of learning are available: stochastic and batch. In stochastic learning, each input creates a weight adjustment. In batch learning weights are adjusted based on a batch of inputs, accumulating errors over the batch. Stochastic learning introduces "noise" into the process, using the local gradient calculated from one data point; this reduces the chance of the network getting stuck in local minima. However, batch learning typically yields a faster, more stable descent to a local minimum, since each update is performed in the direction of the batch's average error. A common compromise is to use "mini-batches", small batches with samples in each batch selected stochastically from the entire data set. 
Types
Main article: Types of artificial neural networks
ANNs have evolved into a broad family of techniques that have advanced the state of the art across multiple domains. The simplest types have one or more static components, including number of units, number of layers, unit weights and topology. Dynamic types allow one or more of these to evolve via learning. The latter is much more complicated but can shorten learning periods and produce better results. Some types allow/require learning to be "supervised" by the operator, while others operate independently. Some types operate purely in hardware, while others are purely software and run on general purpose computers. 
Some of the main breakthroughs include: 
	Convolutional neural networks that have proven particularly successful in processing visual and other two-dimensional data;[153][154] where long short-term memory avoids the vanishing gradient problem[155] and can handle signals that have a mix of low and high frequency components aiding large-vocabulary speech recognition,[156][157] text-to-speech synthesis,[158][159][160] and photo-real talking heads;[161]
	Competitive networks such as generative adversarial networks in which multiple networks (of varying structure) compete with each other, on tasks such as winning a game[162] or on deceiving the opponent about the authenticity of an input.[94]
Network design
Using artificial neural networks requires an understanding of their characteristics. 
	Choice of model: This depends on the data representation and the application. Model parameters include the number, type, and connectedness of network layers, as well as the size of each and the connection type (full, pooling, etc. ). Overly complex models learn slowly.
	Learning algorithm: Numerous trade-offs exist between learning algorithms. Almost any algorithm will work well with the correct hyperparameters[163] for training on a particular data set. However, selecting and tuning an algorithm for training on unseen data requires significant experimentation.
	Robustness: If the model, cost function and learning algorithm are selected appropriately, the resulting ANN can become robust.
Neural architecture search (NAS) uses machine learning to automate ANN design. Various approaches to NAS have designed networks that compare well with hand-designed systems. The basic search algorithm is to propose a candidate model, evaluate it against a dataset, and use the results as feedback to teach the NAS network.[164] Available systems include AutoML and AutoKeras.[165] scikit-learn library provides functions to help with building a deep network from scratch. We can then implement a deep network with TensorFlow or Keras. 
Hyperparameters must also be defined as part of the design (they are not learned), governing matters such as how many neurons are in each layer, learning rate, step, stride, depth, receptive field and padding (for CNNs), etc.[166] 
The Python code snippet provides an overview of the training function, which uses the training dataset, number of hidden layer units, learning rate, and number of iterations as parameters:
def train(X, y, n_hidden, learning_rate, n_iter):
    m, n_input = X.shape

    # 1. random initialize weights and biases
    w1 = np.random.randn(n_input, n_hidden)
    b1 = np.zeros((1, n_hidden))
    w2 = np.random.randn(n_hidden, 1)
    b2 = np.zeros((1, 1))

    # 2. in each iteration, feed all layers with the latest weights and biases
    for i in range(n_iter + 1):
        z2 = np.dot(X, w1) + b1
        a2 = sigmoid(z2)
        z3 = np.dot(a2, w2) + b2
        a3 = z3
        dz3 = a3 - y
        dw2 = np.dot(a2.T, dz3)
        db2 = np.sum(dz3, axis=0, keepdims=True)
        dz2 = np.dot(dz3, w2.T) * sigmoid_derivative(z2)
        dw1 = np.dot(X.T, dz2)
        db1 = np.sum(dz2, axis=0)

        # 3. update weights and biases with gradients
        w1 -= learning_rate * dw1 / m
        w2 -= learning_rate * dw2 / m
        b1 -= learning_rate * db1 / m
        b2 -= learning_rate * db2 / m

        if i % 1000 == 0:
            print("Epoch", i, "loss: ", np.mean(np.square(dz3)))

    model = {"w1": w1, "b1": b1, "w2": w2, "b2": b2}
    return model
[citation needed] 
Applications

	Function approximation,[167] or regression analysis,[168] (including time series prediction, fitness approximation,[169] and modeling)

	Medical diagnosis[183]
ANNs have been used to diagnose several types of cancers[184][185] and to distinguish highly invasive cancer cell lines from less invasive lines using only cell shape information.[186][187] 
ANNs have been used to accelerate reliability analysis of infrastructures subject to natural disasters[188][189] and to predict foundation settlements.[190] It can also be useful to mitigate flood by the use of ANNs for modelling rainfall-runoff.[191] ANNs have also been used for building black-box models in geoscience: hydrology,[192][193] ocean modelling and coastal engineering,[194][195] and geomorphology.[196] ANNs have been employed in cybersecurity, with the objective to discriminate between legitimate activities and malicious ones. For example, machine learning has been used for classifying Android malware,[197] for identifying domains belonging to threat actors and for detecting URLs posing a security risk.[198] Research is underway on ANN systems designed for penetration testing, for detecting botnets,[199] credit cards frauds[200] and network intrusions. 
ANNs have been proposed as a tool to solve partial differential equations in physics[201][202][203] and simulate the properties of many-body open quantum systems.[204][205][206][207] In brain research ANNs have studied short-term behavior of individual neurons,[208] the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems. Studies considered long-and short-term plasticity of neural systems and their relation to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level. 
It is possible to create a profile of a user's interests from pictures, using artificial neural networks trained for object recognition.[209] 
Beyond their traditional applications, artificial neural networks are increasingly being utilized in interdisciplinary research, such as materials science. For instance, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their capability in scaling deep learning for the discovery of new stable materials by efficiently predicting the total energy of crystals. This application underscores the adaptability and potential of ANNs in tackling complex problems beyond the realms of predictive modeling and artificial intelligence, opening new pathways for scientific discovery and innovation.[210] 
Theoretical properties
Computational power
The multilayer perceptron is a universal function approximator, as proven by the universal approximation theorem. However, the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required, the network topology, the weights and the learning parameters. 
A specific recurrent architecture with rational-valued weights (as opposed to full precision real number-valued weights) has the power of a universal Turing machine,[211] using a finite number of neurons and standard linear connections. Further, the use of irrational values for weights results in a machine with super-Turing power.[212][213][failed verification] 
Capacity
A model's "capacity" property corresponds to its ability to model any given function. It is related to the amount of information that can be stored in the network and to the notion of complexity. Two notions of capacity are known by the community. The information capacity and the VC Dimension. The information capacity of a perceptron is intensively discussed in Sir David MacKay's book[214] which summarizes work by Thomas Cover.[215] The capacity of a network of standard neurons (not convolutional) can be derived by four rules[216] that derive from understanding a neuron as an electrical element. The information capacity captures the functions modelable by the network given any data as input. The second notion, is the VC dimension. VC Dimension uses the principles of measure theory and finds the maximum capacity under the best possible circumstances. This is, given input data in a specific form. As noted in,[214] the VC Dimension for arbitrary inputs is half the information capacity of a Perceptron. The VC Dimension for arbitrary points is sometimes referred to as Memory Capacity.[217] 
Convergence
Models may not consistently converge on a single solution, firstly because local minima may exist, depending on the cost function and the model. Secondly, the optimization method used might not guarantee to converge when it begins far from any local minimum. Thirdly, for sufficiently large data or parameters, some methods become impractical. 
Another issue worthy to mention is that training may cross some Saddle point which may lead the convergence to the wrong direction. 
The convergence behavior of certain types of ANN architectures are more understood than others. When the width of network approaches to infinity, the ANN is well described by its first order Taylor expansion throughout training, and so inherits the convergence behavior of affine models.[218][219] Another example is when parameters are small, it is observed that ANNs often fits target functions from low to high frequencies. This behavior is referred to as the spectral bias, or frequency principle, of neural networks.[220][221][222][223] This phenomenon is the opposite to the behavior of some well studied iterative numerical schemes such as Jacobi method. Deeper neural networks have been observed to be more biased towards low frequency functions.[224]

Applications whose goal is to create a system that generalizes well to unseen examples, face the possibility of over-training. This arises in convoluted or over-specified systems when the network capacity significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. Two approaches address over-training. The first is to use cross-validation and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-training and to select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error. 
The second is to use some form of regularization. This concept emerges in a probabilistic (Bayesian) framework, where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models; but also in statistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over two quantities: the 'empirical risk' and the 'structural risk', which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to overfitting. 
 Confidence analysis of a neural network 
Supervised neural networks that use a mean squared error (MSE) cost function can use formal statistical methods to determine the confidence of the trained model. The MSE on a validation set can be used as an estimate for variance. This value can then be used to calculate the confidence interval of network output, assuming a normal distribution. A confidence analysis made this way is statistically valid as long as the output probability distribution stays the same and the network is not modified. 
By assigning a softmax activation function, a generalization of the logistic function, on the output layer of the neural network (or a softmax component in a component-based network) for categorical target variables, the outputs can be interpreted as posterior probabilities. This is useful in classification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications. 
The softmax activation function is: 
 

Criticism
Training
A common criticism of neural networks, particularly in robotics, is that they require too many training samples for real-world operation.[225] Any learning machine needs sufficient representative examples in order to capture the underlying structure that allows it to generalize to new cases. Potential solutions include randomly shuffling training examples, by using a numerical optimization algorithm that does not take too large steps when changing the network connections following an example, grouping examples in so-called mini-batches and/or introducing a recursive least squares algorithm for CMAC.[151] Dean Pomerleau uses a neural network to train a robotic vehicle to drive on multiple types of roads (single lane, multi-lane, dirt, etc.), and a large amount of his research is devoted to extrapolating multiple training scenarios from a single training experience, and preserving past training diversity so that the system does not become overtrained (if, for example, it is presented with a series of right turns—it should not learn to always turn right).[226] 
Theory
A central claim[citation needed] of ANNs is that they embody new and powerful general principles for processing information. These principles are ill-defined. It is often claimed[by whom?] that they are emergent from the network itself. This allows simple statistical association (the basic function of artificial neural networks) to be described as learning or recognition. In 1997, Alexander Dewdney, a former Scientific American columnist, commented that as a result, artificial neural networks have a "something-for-nothing quality, one that imparts a peculiar aura of laziness and a distinct lack of curiosity about just how good these computing systems are. No human hand (or mind) intervenes; solutions are found as if by magic; and no one, it seems, has learned anything".[227] One response to Dewdney is that neural networks have been successfully used to handle many complex and diverse tasks, ranging from autonomously flying aircraft[228] to detecting credit card fraud to mastering the game of Go. 
Technology writer Roger Bridgman commented: 
Neural networks, for instance, are in the dock not only because they have been hyped to high heaven, (what hasn't?) but also because you could create a successful net without understanding how it worked: the bunch of numbers that captures its behaviour would in all probability be "an opaque, unreadable table...valueless as a scientific resource". 
In spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology, Dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them are just trying to be good engineers. An unreadable table that a useful machine could read would still be well worth having.[229] 
Although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult, it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network. Moreover, recent emphasis on the explainability of AI has contributed towards the development of methods, notably those based on attention mechanisms, for visualizing and explaining learned neural networks. Furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering generic principles that allow a learning machine to be successful. For example, Bengio and LeCun (2007) wrote an article regarding local vs non-local learning, as well as shallow vs deep architecture.[230] 
Biological brains use both shallow and deep circuits as reported by brain anatomy,[231] displaying a wide variety of invariance. Weng[232] argued that the brain self-wires largely according to signal statistics and therefore, a serial cascade cannot catch all major statistical dependencies. 
Hardware
Large and effective neural networks require considerable computing resources.[233] While the brain has hardware tailored to the task of processing signals through a graph of neurons, simulating even a simplified neuron on von Neumann architecture may consume vast amounts of memory and storage. Furthermore, the designer often needs to transmit signals through many of these connections and their associated neurons – which require enormous CPU power and time.[citation needed] 
Some argue that the resurgence of neural networks in the twenty-first century is largely attributable to advances in hardware: from 1991 to 2015, computing power, especially as delivered by GPGPUs (on GPUs), has increased around a million-fold, making the standard backpropagation algorithm feasible for training networks that are several layers deeper than before.[38] The use of accelerators such as FPGAs and GPUs can reduce training times from months to days.[233][234] 
Neuromorphic engineering or a physical neural network addresses the hardware difficulty directly, by constructing non-von-Neumann chips to directly implement neural networks in circuitry. Another type of chip optimized for neural network processing is called a Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU.[235] 
Practical counterexamples
Analyzing what has been learned by an ANN is much easier than analyzing what has been learned by a biological neural network. Furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful. For example, local vs. non-local learning and shallow vs. deep architecture.[236] 
Hybrid approaches
Advocates of hybrid models (combining neural networks and symbolic approaches) say that such a mixture can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind.[237][238] 
Dataset bias
Neural networks are dependent on the quality of the data they are trained on, thus low quality data with imbalanced representativeness can lead to the model learning and perpetuating societal biases.[239][240] These inherited biases become especially critical when the ANNs are integrated into real-world scenarios where the training data may be imbalanced due to the scarcity of data for a specific race, gender or other attribute.[239] This imbalance can result in the model having inadequate representation and understanding of underrepresented groups, leading to discriminatory outcomes that exacerbate societal inequalities, especially in applications like facial recognition, hiring processes, and law enforcement.[240][241] For example, in 2018, Amazon had to scrap a recruiting tool because the model favored men over women for jobs in software engineering due to the higher number of male workers in the field.[241] The program would penalize any resume with the word "woman" or the name of any women's college. However, the use of synthetic data can help reduce dataset bias and increase representation in datasets.[242]

Recent advancements and future directions
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have undergone significant advancements, particularly in their ability to model complex systems, handle large data sets, and adapt to various types of applications. Their evolution over the past few decades has been marked by a broad range of applications in fields such as image processing, speech recognition, natural language processing, finance, and medicine.[citation needed] 
Image processing
In the realm of image processing, ANNs are employed in tasks such as image classification, object recognition, and image segmentation. For instance, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been important in handwritten digit recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance.[243] This demonstrates the ability of ANNs to effectively process and interpret complex visual information, leading to advancements in fields ranging from automated surveillance to medical imaging.[243] 
Speech recognition
By modeling speech signals, ANNs are used for tasks like speaker identification and speech-to-text conversion. Deep neural network architectures have introduced significant improvements in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, outperforming traditional techniques.[243][244] These advancements have enabled the development of more accurate and efficient voice-activated systems, enhancing user interfaces in technology products.[citation needed] 
Natural language processing
In natural language processing, ANNs are used for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. They have enabled the development of models that can accurately translate between languages, understand the context and sentiment in textual data, and categorize text based on content.[243][244] This has implications for automated customer service, content moderation, and language understanding technologies.[citation needed] 
Control systems
In the domain of control systems, ANNs are used to model dynamic systems for tasks such as system identification, control design, and optimization. For instance, deep feedforward neural networks are important in system identification and control applications.[citation needed] 
Finance
Further information: Applications of artificial intelligence § Trading and investment
ANNs are used for stock market prediction and credit scoring: 
	In investing, ANNs can process vast amounts of financial data, recognize complex patterns, and forecast stock market trends, aiding investors and risk managers in making informed decisions.[243]
	In credit scoring, ANNs offer data-driven, personalized assessments of creditworthiness, improving the accuracy of default predictions and automating the lending process.[244]
ANNs require high-quality data and careful tuning, and their "black-box" nature can pose challenges in interpretation. Nevertheless, ongoing advancements suggest that ANNs continue to play a role in finance, offering valuable insights and enhancing risk management strategies.[citation needed] 
Medicine
ANNs are able to process and analyze vast medical datasets. They enhance diagnostic accuracy, especially by interpreting complex medical imaging for early disease detection, and by predicting patient outcomes for personalized treatment planning.[244] In drug discovery, ANNs speed up the identification of potential drug candidates and predict their efficacy and safety, significantly reducing development time and costs.[243] Additionally, their application in personalized medicine and healthcare data analysis allows tailored therapies and efficient patient care management.[244] Ongoing research is aimed at addressing remaining challenges such as data privacy and model interpretability, as well as expanding the scope of ANN applications in medicine.[citation needed] 
Content creation
ANNs such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) and transformers are used for content creation across numerous industries.[245] This is because deep learning models are able to learn the style of an artist or musician from huge datasets and generate completely new artworks and music compositions. For instance, DALL-E is a deep neural network trained on 650 million pairs of images and texts across the internet that can create artworks based on text entered by the user.[246] In the field of music, transformers are used to create original music for commercials and documentaries through companies such as AIVA and Jukedeck.[247] In the marketing industry generative models are used to create personalized advertisements for consumers.[245] Additionally, major film companies are partnering with technology companies to analyze the financial success of a film, such as the partnership between Warner Bros and technology company Cinelytic established in 2020.[248] Furthermore, neural networks have found uses in video game creation, where Non Player Characters (NPCs) can make decisions based on all the characters currently in the game.[249]

Neural computation is the information processing performed by networks of neurons. Neural computation is affiliated with the philosophical tradition known as Computational theory of mind, also referred to as computationalism, which advances the thesis that neural computation explains cognition. The first persons to propose an account of neural activity as being computational was Warren McCullock and Walter Pitts in their seminal 1943 paper, A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity. 
There are three general branches of computationalism, including classicism, connectionism, and computational neuroscience. All three branches agree that cognition is computation, however, they disagree on what sorts of computations constitute cognition. The classicism tradition believes that computation in the brain is digital, analogous to digital computing. Both connectionism and computational neuroscience do not require that the computations that realize cognition are necessarily digital computations. However, the two branches greatly disagree upon which sorts of experimental data should be used to construct explanatory models of cognitive phenomena. Connectionists rely upon behavioral evidence to construct models to explain cognitive phenomena, whereas computational neuroscience leverages neuroanatomical and neurophysiological information to construct mathematical models that explain cognition.[1] 
When comparing the three main traditions of the computational theory of mind, as well as the different possible forms of computation in the brain, it is helpful to define what we mean by computation in a general sense. Computation is the processing of information, otherwise known as variables or entities, according to a set of rules. A rule in this sense is simply an instruction for executing a manipulation on the current state of the variable, in order to produce a specified output. In other words, a rule dictates which output to produce given a certain input to the computing system. A computing system is a mechanism whose components must be functionally organized to process the information in accordance with the established set of rules. The types of information processed by a computing system determine which type of computations it performs. Traditionally, in cognitive science there have been two proposed types of computation related to neural activity - digital and analog, with the vast majority of theoretical work incorporating a digital understanding of cognition. Computing systems that perform digital computation are functionally organized to execute operations on strings of digits with respect to the type and location of the digit on the string. It has been argued that neural spike train signaling implements some form of digital computation, since neural spikes may be considered as discrete units or digits, like 0 or 1 - the neuron either fires an action potential or it does not. Accordingly, neural spike trains could be seen as strings of digits. Alternatively, analog computing systems perform manipulations on non-discrete, irreducibly continuous variables, that is, entities that vary continuously as a function of time. These sorts of operations are characterized by systems of differential equations.[1] 
Neural computation can be studied for example by building models of neural computation. 
There is a scientific journal dedicated to this subject, Neural Computation. 
Artificial neural networks (ANN) is a subfield of the research area machine learning. Work on ANNs has been somewhat inspired by knowledge of neural computation.[1]

1.1 An “inner screen” theory of seeing
One theory of this kind proposes that there is a set of brain cells whose level of activity represents the brightness of points
in the scene. This theory therefore suggests that seeing is akin to photography. Note that the image of Lennon is inverted in
the eye, due to the optics of the eye, but it is shown upright in the brain to match our perceptions of the world—see page 8.

that links the eyes to the cortex.
world, and how is it obtained? It is this problem
which provides the subject of this book.
Perception, Consciousness, and Brain Cells
One reason why it might feel strange to regard
visual experience as being encoded in brain cells is
that they may seem quite insufficient for the task.
The “inner screen” theory posits a direct relation-
ship between conscious visual experiences and
activity in certain brain cells. That is, activity in
certain cells is somehow accompanied by conscious
experience. Proposing this kind of parallelism
between brain-cell activity and visual experience is
characteristic of many theories of perceptual brain
mechanisms. But is there more to it than this? Can
the richness of visual experience really be identi-
fied with activity in a few million, or even a few
trillion, brain cells? Are brain cells the right kind of
entities to provide conscious perceptual experience?
We return to these questions in Ch 22. For the
moment, we simply note that most vision scientists
get on with the job of studying seeing without
concerning themselves much with the issue of
consciousness.
Pictures in the Brain
You might reasonably ask at this point: has neu-
roscience has anything to say directly about the
“inner screen” theory? Is there any evidence from
studies of the brain as to whether such a screen or
anything like it exists?
The major visual pathway carrying the messages
from the eyes to the brain is shown in broad out-
line in 1.5. Fuller details are shown in 1.6 in which
the eyes are shown inspecting a person, and the
locations of the various parts of this scene “in” the
visual system are shown with the help of numbers.
The first thing to notice is that the eyes do not
receive identical images. The left eye sees rather
more of the scene to the left of the central line of
sight (regions 1 and 2), and vice versa for the right
eye (regions 8 and 9). There are other differences
between the left and right eyes’ images in the case
of 3D scenes: these are described fully in Ch 18.
Next, notice the optic nerves leaving the eyes.
The fibers within each optic nerve are the axons
of certain retinal cells, and they carry messages
from the retina to the brain. The left and right
optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm, 1.6 and 9.9,
where the optic nerve bundle from each eye splits
in two. Half of the fibers from each eye cross to the
opposite side of the brain, whereas the other half
stay on the same side of the brain throughout.
The net result of this partial crossing-over of
fibers (technically called partial decussation) is
that messages dealing with any given region of the
field of view arrive at a common destination in the
cortex, regardless of which eye they come from. In
other words, left- and right-eye views of any given
feature of a scene are analyzed in the same physi-
cal location in the striate cortex. This is the major
receiving area in the cortex for messages sent along
nerve fibers in the optic nerves.
Fibers from the optic chiasm enter the left and
right lateral geniculate nuclei. These are the first
“relay stations” of the fibers from the eyes on their
way to the striate cortex. That is, axons from the
retina terminate here on the dendrites of new neu-
rons, and it is the axons of the latter cells that then
proceed to the cortex. A good deal of mystery still

brain structure which lies underneath the cortex,
1.5, so it is said to be sub-cortical. Its function is
different from that performed by regions of the
cortex devoted to vision. The weight of evidence
at present suggests that the superior colliculus
is concerned with guiding visual attention. For
example, if an object suddenly appears in the field
of view, mechanisms within the superior colliculus
detect its presence, work out its location, and then
guide eye movements so that the novel object can
be observed directly.
It is important to realize that other visual path-
ways exist apart from the two main ones shown in
1.6. In fact, in monkeys and most probably also
in man, optic nerve fibers directly feed at least
six different brain sites. This is testimony to the
enormously important role of vision for ourselves
and similar species. Indeed, it has been estimated
that roughly 60% of the brain is involved in vision
in one way or another.
Returning now to the issue of pictures-in-the-
brain, the striking thing in 1.6 is the orderly, albeit
curious, layout of fiber terminations in the striate
cortex.
First, note that a face is shown mapped out on
the cortical surface (cortical means “of the cortex”).
This is the face that the eyes are inspecting.
Second, the representation is upside-down.
The retinal images (not shown in 1.6) are also
upside-down due to the way the optics of the eyes
work, 1.1. Notice that the sketch of the “inner
screen” in 1.1 showed a right-way-up image, so it
is different in that respect from the mapping found
in the striate cortex.
Third, the mapping is such that the representa-
tion of the scene is cut right down the middle, and
each half of the cortex (technically, each cerebral
hemisphere) deals initially with just one half of the
scene.
Fourth, and perhaps most oddly, the cut in the
representation places adjacent regions of the central
part of the scene farthest apart in the brain!
Fifth, the mapping is spatially distorted in that
a greater area of cortex is devoted to central vision
than to peripheral: hence the relatively swollen
face and the diminutive arm and hand, 1.7. This
doesn’t mean of course that we actually see people
in this distorted way—obviously we don’t. But it
1.7 Mapping of the retinal image in the striate cortex (schematic)
Turn the book upside-down for a better appreciation of the distortion of the scene in cortex. The hyperfields are regions of
the retinal image that project to hypothetical structures called hypercolumns (denoted as graph-paper squares in the part
of the striate cortex map shown here, which derives from the left hand sides of the left and right retinal images; more details
in Chs 9 and10). Hyperfields are much smaller in central than in peripheral vision, so relatively more cells are devoted to
central vision. Hyperfields have receptive fields in both images but here two are shown for the right image only.

reveals that a much larger area in our brain is as-
signed to foveal vision (i.e., analyzing what we are
directly looking at) than is devoted to peripheral
vision. This dedication of most cortical tissue to
foveal vision is why we are much better at seeing
details in the region of the scene we are looking at
than we are at seeing details which fall out toward
the edges of our field of view.
All in all, the cortical mapping of incoming
visual fibers is curious but orderly. That is, adjacent
regions of cortex deal with adjacent regions of the
scene (with the exception of the mid-line cut). The
technical term for this sort of mapping is topo-
graphic. In this instance it is called retinotopic as
the mapping preserves the neighborhood relation-
ships that exist between cells in the retina (except
for the split down the middle). The general orderli-
ness of the mapping is reminiscent of the “inner
screen” proposed in 1.1. But the oddities of the
mapping should give any “inner screen” theorist
pause for thought. The first “screen,” if such it is,
we meet in the brain is a very strange one indeed.
The striate cortex is not the only region of
cortex to be concerned with vision—far from it.
Fibers travel from the striate cortex to adjacent
regions, called the pre-striate cortex because they
lie just in front of the striate region. These fibers
preserve the orderliness of the mapping found in
the striate region. There are in fact topographically
organized visual regions in the pre-striate zone and
we describe these maps in Ch 10. For the present,
we just note that each one seems to be special-
ized for a particular kind of visual analysis, such
as color, motion, etc. One big mystery is how the
visual world can appear to us as such a well-inte-
grated whole if its analysis is actually conducted at
very many different sites, each one serving a differ-
ent analytic function.
To summarize this section, brain maps exist
which bear some resemblance to the kind of “inner
screen” idea hesitantly advanced by our fictional
“ordinary person” who was pressed to hazard a
guess at what goes on the brain when we see.
However, the map shown in 1.6-1.7 is not much
like the one envisaged in 1.1, being both distorted,
upside-down and cut into two.
These oddities seriously undermine the pho-
tographic metaphor for seeing. But it is timely to
change tack now from looking inside the brain for
an “inner screen” and to examine in detail serious
logical problems with the “inner screen” idea as a
theory of seeing. We begin this task by considering
man-made systems for seeing.
Machines for Seeing
A great deal of research has been done on building
computer vision systems that can do visual tasks.
These take in images of a scene as input, analyze
the visual information in these images, and then
use that information for some purpose or other,
such as guiding a robot hand or stating what ob-
jects the scene contains and where they are. In our
terminology, a machine of this type is deriving a
scene description from input images.
Whether one should call such a device a
“perceiver,” a “seeing machine,” or more humbly
an “image processor” or “pattern recognizer,” is a
moot point which may hinge on whether con-
sciousness can ever be associated with non-biologi-
cal brains. In any event, scientists who work on the
problem of devising automatic image-processing
machines would call the activity appearing on the
“inner screen” of 1.1 a kind of gray level descrip-
tion of the painting. This is because the “inner
screen” is a representation signaling the various
shades of gray all over the picture, 1.8. (We ignore
color in the present discussion, and also many
intricacies in the perception of gray: see Ch 16).
Each individual brain cell in the screen is describ-
ing the gray level at one particular point of the
picture in terms of an activity code. The code is
simple: the lighter or more brightly illuminated the
point in the painting, the more active the cell.
The familiar desktop image scanner is an ex-
ample of a human-made device that delivers gray
level descriptions. Its optical sensor sweeps over the
image laid face down on its glass surface, thereby
measuring gray levels directly rather than from a
lens-focused image. Their scanning is technically
described as a serial operation as it deals with dif-
ferent regions of the image in sequence.
Digital cameras measure the point by point
intensities of images focused on their light sensi-
tive surfaces, so in this regard they are similar to
biological eyes. They are said to operate in parallel
because they take their intensity measurements
everywhere over the image at the same instant.
Hence they can deliver their gray levels quickly.
Chapter 1

The intensity measurements taken by both scan-
ners and digital cameras are recorded as numbers
stored in a digital memory. To call this collection
of numbers a “gray level description” is apt because
this is exactly what the numbers are providing, as
in 1.8.
The term “gray level” arises from the black-
and-white nature of the system, with black being
regarded as a very dark gray (and recorded with a
small number) and white as a very light gray (and
recorded with a large number).
The numbers are a description in the sense
defined earlier: they make explicit the gray levels
in the input image. That is, they make these gray
levels immediately usable (which means there is
no need for further processing to recover them) by
subsequent stages of image processing.
Retinal images are upside-down, due to the
optics of the eyes (Ch 2) and many people are
worried by this. “Why doesn’t the world therefore
appear upside down?”, they ask.
The answer is simple: as long as there is a
systematic correspondence between the outside
scene and the retinal image, the processes of image
interpretation can rely on this correspondence, and
build up the required scene description according-
ly. Upside-down in the image is simply interpreted
as right-way-up in the world, and that’s all there is
to it.
If an observer is equipped with special spectacles
which optically invert the retinal images so that
they become the “right-way-up,” then the world
appears upside-down until the observer learns to
cope with the new correspondence between image
and scene. This adjustment process can take weeks,
but it is possible. The exact nature of the adjust-
ment process is not yet clear: does the upside-down
world really begin to “look” right-way-up again, or
is it simply that the observer learns new patterns of
adjusted movement to cope with the strange new
perceptual world he finds himself in?

An ordinary domestic black-and-white TV set
also produces an image that is an array of dots.
The individual dots are so tiny that they cannot
be readily distinguished (unless a TV screen is
observed from quite close).
Representations and Descriptions
It is easy to see why the computer’s gray level
description illustrated in 1.8 is a similar sort
of representation to the hypothetical “inner
screen” shown in 1.1. In the latter, brain cells
adopt different levels of activity to repre-
sent (or code) different pixel intensities. In
the former, the computer holds different
numbers in its memory registers to do
exactly the same job. So both systems
provide a representation of
the gray level description
of their input image,
even though the
physical stuff
carrying this
description
(computer
hardware vs. brain-
ware) is different in
the two cases. This
distinction between
the functional or design
status of a representation (the
job it performs) and the physical embodiment of
the representation (different in man or machine
of course) is an extremely important one which
deserves further elaboration.
Consider, for example, the physical layout of the
hypothetical “inner screen” of brain cells. This is an
anatomically neat one, with the various pixel cells
arranged in a format which physically matches the
arrangement of the corresponding image points.
Gray Level Resolution
The number of pixels (shorthand for picture ele-
ments) in a computer’s gray level description varies
according to the capabilities of the computer (e.g.,
the size of its memory) and the needs of the user.
For example, a dense array of pixels requires a large
memory and produces a gray level description that
picks up very fine details. This is now familiar to
many people due to the availability of digital cam-
eras that capture high resolution images using mil-
lions of pixels. When these are output as full-tone
printouts, the images are difficult to discriminate
from film-based photographs.
If fewer pixels are used, so that each pixel rep-
resents the average intensity over quite a large area
of the input image, then a full-tone printout of the
same size takes on a block-like appearance. That is,
these images are said to show quantization effects.
These possibilities are illustrated in 1.9, where the
same input image is represented by four different
gray level images, with pixel arrays ranging from
high to low resolution.

Abstract
Studies in biological vision have always been a great source of inspiration for design of computer vision algorithms. In the past, several successful methods were designed with varying degrees of correspondence with biological vision studies, ranging from purely functional inspiration to methods that utilise models that were primarily developed for explaining biological observations. Even though it seems well recognised that computational models of biological vision can help in design of computer vision algorithms, it is a non-trivial exercise for a computer vision researcher to mine relevant information from biological vision literature as very few studies in biology are organised at a task level. In this paper we aim to bridge this gap by providing a computer vision task centric presentation of models primarily originating in biological vision studies. Not only do we revisit some of the main features of biological vision and discuss the foundations of existing computational studies modelling biological vision, but also we consider three classical computer vision tasks from a biological perspective: image sensing, segmentation and optical flow. Using this task-centric approach, we discuss well-known biological functional principles and compare them with approaches taken by computer vision. Based on this comparative analysis of computer and biological vision, we present some recent models in biological vision and highlight a few models that we think are promising for future investigations in computer vision. To this extent, this paper provides new insights and a starting point for investigators interested in the design of biology-based computer vision algorithms and pave a way for much needed interaction between the two communities leading to the development of synergistic models of artificial and biological vision.

1. Introduction
Biological vision systems are remarkable at extracting and analysing the essential information for vital functional needs such as navigating through complex environments, finding food or escaping from a danger. It is remarkable that biological visual systems perform all these tasks with both high sensitivity and strong reliability given the fact that natural images are highly noisy, cluttered, highly variable and ambiguous. Still, even simple biological systems can efficiently and quickly solve most of the difficult computational problems that are still challenging for artificial systems such as scene segmentation, local and global optical flow computation, 3D perception or extracting the meaning of complex objects or movements. All these aspects have been intensively investigated in human psychophysics and the neuronal underpinnings of visual performance have been scrutinised over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from single cell to large cortical networks so that visual systems are certainly the best-known of all neural systems (see Chalupa and Werner, 2004 for an encyclopaedic review). As a consequence, biological visual computations are certainly the most understood of all cognitive neural systems.
It would seem natural that biological and computer vision research would interact continuously since they target the same goals at task leve

A knowledge-based system (KBS) is a computer program that reasons and uses a knowledge base to solve complex problems. Knowledge-based systems were the focus of early artificial intelligence researchers in the 1980s. The term can refer to a broad range of systems. However, all knowledge-based systems have two defining components: an attempt to represent knowledge explicitly, called a knowledge base, and a reasoning system that allows them to derive new knowledge, known as an inference engine. 
Components
The knowledge base contains domain-specific facts and rules[1] about a problem domain (rather than knowledge implicitly embedded in procedural code, as in a conventional computer program). In addition, the knowledge may be structured by means of a subsumption ontology, frames, conceptual graph, or logical assertions.[2] 
The inference engine uses general-purpose reasoning methods to infer new knowledge and to solve problems in the problem domain. Most commonly, it employs forward chaining or backward chaining. Other approaches include the use of automated theorem proving, logic programming, blackboard systems, and term rewriting systems such as Constraint Handling Rules (CHR). These more formal approaches are covered in detail in the Wikipedia article on knowledge representation and reasoning. 
Aspects and development of early systems
Knowledge-based vs. expert systems
See also: Expert system
The term "knowledge-based system" was often used interchangeably with "expert system", possibly because almost all of the earliest knowledge-based systems were designed for expert tasks. However, these terms tell us about different aspects of a system: 
	expert: describes only the task the system is designed for – its purpose is to aid replace a human expert in a task typically requiring specialised knowledge
	knowledge-based: refers only to the system's architecture – it represents knowledge explicitly, rather than as procedural code
Today, virtually all expert systems are knowledge-based, whereas knowledge-based system architecture is used in a wide range of types of system designed for a variety of tasks. 
Rule-based systems
Main article: Rule-based system
The first knowledge-based systems were primarily rule-based expert systems. These represented facts about the world as simple assertions in a flat database and used domain-specific rules to reason about these assertions, and then to add to them. One of the most famous of these early systems was Mycin, a program for medical diagnosis. 
Representing knowledge explicitly via rules had several advantages: 
	Acquisition and maintenance. Using rules meant that domain experts could often define and maintain the rules themselves rather than via a programmer.
	Explanation. Representing knowledge explicitly allowed systems to reason about how they came to a conclusion and use this information to explain results to users. For example, to follow the chain of inferences that led to a diagnosis and use these facts to explain the diagnosis.
	Reasoning. Decoupling the knowledge from the processing of that knowledge enabled general purpose inference engines to be developed. These systems could develop conclusions that followed from a data set that the initial developers may not have even been aware of.[3]
Meta-reasoning
Later[when?] architectures for knowledge-based reasoning, such as the BB1 blackboard architecture (a blackboard system),[4] allowed the reasoning process itself to be affected by new inferences, providing meta-level reasoning. BB1 allowed the problem-solving process itself to be monitored. Different kinds of problem-solving (e.g., top-down, bottom-up, and opportunistic problem-solving) could be selectively mixed based on the current state of problem solving. Essentially, the problem-solver was being used both to solve a domain-level problem along with its own control problem, which could depend on the former. 
Other examples of knowledge-based system architectures supporting meta-level reasoning are MRS[5] and SOAR. 
Widening of application
In the 1980s and 1990s, in addition to expert systems, other applications of knowledge-based systems included real-time process control,[6] intelligent tutoring systems,[7] and problem-solvers for specific domains such as protein structure analysis,[8] construction-site layout,[9] and computer system fault diagnosis.[10] 
Advances driven by enhanced architecture
As knowledge-based systems became more complex, the techniques used to represent the knowledge base became more sophisticated and included logic, term-rewriting systems, conceptual graphs, and frames. 
Frames, for example, are a way representing world knowledge using techniques that can be seen as analogous to object-oriented programming, specifically classes and subclasses, hierarchies and relations between classes, and behavior[clarification needed] of objects. With the knowledge base more structured, reasoning could now occur not only by independent rules and logical inference, but also based on interactions within the knowledge base itself. For example, procedures stored as daemons on[clarification needed] objects could fire and could replicate the chaining behavior of rules.[11] 
Advances in automated reasoning
Another advancement in the 1990s was the development of special purpose automated reasoning systems called classifiers. Rather than statically declare the subsumption relations in a knowledge-base, a classifier allows the developer to simply declare facts about the world and let the classifier deduce the relations. In this way a classifier also can play the role of an inference engine.[12] 
The most recent[as of?] advancement of knowledge-based systems was to adopt the technologies, especially a kind of logic called description logic, for the development of systems that use the internet. The internet often has to deal with complex, unstructured data that cannot be relied on to fit a specific data model. The technology of knowledge-based systems, and especially the ability to classify objects on demand, is ideal for such systems. The model for these kinds of knowledge-based internet systems is known as the Semantic Web.[13]

Fiber-optic communication is a method of transmitting information from one place to another by sending pulses of infrared or visible light through an optical fiber.[1][2] The light is a form of carrier wave that is modulated to carry information.[3] Fiber is preferred over electrical cabling when high bandwidth, long distance, or immunity to electromagnetic interference is required.[4] This type of communication can transmit voice, video, and telemetry through local area networks or across long distances.[5] 
Optical fiber is used by many telecommunications companies to transmit telephone signals, internet communication, and cable television signals. Researchers at Bell Labs have reached a record bandwidth–distance product of over 100 petabit × kilometers per second using fiber-optic communication.[6][better source needed] 
Background
First developed in the 1970s, fiber-optics have revolutionized the telecommunications industry and have played a major role in the advent of the Information Age.[7] Because of its advantages over electrical transmission, optical fibers have largely replaced copper wire communications in backbone networks in the developed world.[8] 
The process of communicating using fiber optics involves the following basic steps: 
	creating the optical signal involving the use of a transmitter,[9] usually from an electrical signal
	relaying the signal along the fiber, ensuring that the signal does not become too distorted or weak
	receiving the optical signal
	converting it into an electrical signal
Applications
Optical fiber is used by telecommunications companies to transmit telephone signals, Internet communication and cable television signals. It is also used in other industries, including medical, defense, government, industrial and commercial. In addition to serving the purposes of telecommunications, it is used as light guides, for imaging tools, lasers, hydrophones for seismic waves, SONAR, and as sensors to measure pressure and temperature. 
Due to lower attenuation and interference, optical fiber has advantages over copper wire in long-distance, high-bandwidth applications. However, infrastructure development within cities is relatively difficult and time-consuming, and fiber-optic systems can be complex and expensive to install and operate. Due to these difficulties, early fiber-optic communication systems were primarily installed in long-distance applications, where they can be used to their full transmission capacity, offsetting the increased cost. The prices of fiber-optic communications have dropped considerably since 2000.[10] 
The price for rolling out fiber to homes has currently become more cost-effective than that of rolling out a copper-based network. Prices have dropped to $850 per subscriber in the US and lower in countries like The Netherlands, where digging costs are low and housing density is high.[citation needed] 
Since 1990, when optical-amplification systems became commercially available, the telecommunications industry has laid a vast network of intercity and transoceanic fiber communication lines. By 2002, an intercontinental network of 250,000 km of submarine communications cable with a capacity of 2.56 Tb/s was completed, and although specific network capacities are privileged information, telecommunications investment reports indicate that network capacity has increased dramatically since 2004.[11] As of 2020, over 5 billion kilometers of fiber-optic cable has been deployed around the globe.[12] 
History
In 1880 Alexander Graham Bell and his assistant Charles Sumner Tainter created a very early precursor to fiber-optic communications, the Photophone, at Bell's newly established Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C. Bell considered it his most important invention. The device allowed for the transmission of sound on a beam of light. On June 3, 1880, Bell conducted the world's first wireless telephone transmission between two buildings, some 213 meters apart.[13][14] Due to its use of an atmospheric transmission medium, the Photophone would not prove practical until advances in laser and optical fiber technologies permitted the secure transport of light. The Photophone's first practical use came in military communication systems many decades later.[15] 
In 1954 Harold Hopkins and Narinder Singh Kapany showed that rolled fiber glass allowed light to be transmitted.[16] Jun-ichi Nishizawa, a Japanese scientist at Tohoku University, proposed the use of optical fibers for communications in 1963.[17] Nishizawa invented the PIN diode and the static induction transistor, both of which contributed to the development of optical fiber communications.[18][19] 
In 1966 Charles K. Kao and George Hockham at Standard Telecommunication Laboratories showed that the losses of 1,000 dB/km in existing glass (compared to 5–10 dB/km in coaxial cable) were due to contaminants which could potentially be removed. 
Optical fiber with attenuation low enough for communication purposes (about 20 dB/km) was developed in 1970 by Corning Glass Works. At the same time, GaAs semiconductor lasers were developed that were compact and therefore suitable for transmitting light through fiber optic cables for long distances. 
In 1973, Optelecom, Inc., co-founded by the inventor of the laser, Gordon Gould, received a contract from ARPA for one of the first optical communication systems. Developed for Army Missile Command in Huntsville, Alabama, the system was intended to allow a short-range missile with video processing to communicate by laser to the ground by means of a five-kilometer long optical fiber that unspooled from the missile as it flew.[20] Optelecom then delivered the first commercial optical communications system to Chevron.[21] 
After a period of research starting from 1975, the first commercial fiber-optic telecommunications system was developed which operated at a wavelength around 0.8 μm and used GaAs semiconductor lasers. This first-generation system operated at a bit rate of 45 Mbit/s with repeater spacing of up to 10 km. Soon on 22 April 1977, General Telephone and Electronics sent the first live telephone traffic through fiber optics at a 6 Mbit/s throughput in Long Beach, California.[citation needed] 
In October 1973, Corning Glass signed a development contract with CSELT and Pirelli aimed to test fiber optics in an urban environment: in September 1977, the second cable in this test series, named COS-2, was experimentally deployed in two lines (9 km) in Turin, for the first time in a big city, at a speed of 140 Mbit/s.[22] 
The second generation of fiber-optic communication was developed for commercial use in the early 1980s, operated at 1.3 μm and used InGaAsP semiconductor lasers. These early systems were initially limited by multi-mode fiber dispersion, and in 1981 the single-mode fiber was revealed to greatly improve system performance, however practical connectors capable of working with single mode fiber proved difficult to develop. Canadian service provider SaskTel had completed construction of what was then the world's longest commercial fiber optic network, which covered 3,268 km (2,031 mi) and linked 52 communities.[23] By 1987, these systems were operating at bit rates of up to 1.7 Gbit/s with repeater spacing up to 50 km (31 mi). 
The first transatlantic telephone cable to use optical fiber was TAT-8, based on Desurvire optimized laser amplification technology. It went into operation in 1988. 
Third-generation fiber-optic systems operated at 1.55 μm and had losses of about 0.2 dB/km. This development was spurred by the discovery of indium gallium arsenide and the development of the indium gallium arsenide photodiode by Pearsall. Engineers overcame earlier difficulties with pulse-spreading using conventional InGaAsP semiconductor lasers at that wavelength by using dispersion-shifted fibers designed to have minimal dispersion at 1.55 μm or by limiting the laser spectrum to a single longitudinal mode. These developments eventually allowed third-generation systems to operate commercially at 2.5 Gbit/s with repeater spacing in excess of 100 km (62 mi). 
The fourth generation of fiber-optic communication systems used optical amplification to reduce the need for repeaters and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) to increase data capacity. The introduction of WDM was the start of optical networking, as WDM became the technology of choice for fiber-optic bandwidth expansion.[24] The first to market with a dense WDM system was Ciena Corp., in June 1996.[25] The introduction of optical amplifiers and WDM caused system capacity to double every six months from 1992 until a bit rate of 10 Tb/s was reached by 2001. In 2006 a bit-rate of 14 Tb/s was reached over a single 160 km (99 mi) line using optical amplifiers.[26] As of 2021, Japanese scientists transmitted 319 terabits per second over 3,000 kilometers with four-core fiber cables with standard cable diameter.[27] 
The focus of development for the fifth generation of fiber-optic communications is on extending the wavelength range over which a WDM system can operate. The conventional wavelength window, known as the C band, covers the wavelength range 1525–1565 nm, and dry fiber has a low-loss window promising an extension of that range to 1300–1650 nm.[citation needed] Other developments include the concept of optical solitons, pulses that preserve their shape by counteracting the effects of dispersion with the nonlinear effects of the fiber by using pulses of a specific shape. 
In the late 1990s through 2000, industry promoters, and research companies such as KMI, and RHK predicted massive increases in demand for communications bandwidth due to increased use of the Internet, and commercialization of various bandwidth-intensive consumer services, such as video on demand. Internet Protocol data traffic was increasing exponentially, at a faster rate than integrated circuit complexity had increased under Moore's Law. From the bust of the dot-com bubble through 2006, however, the main trend in the industry has been consolidation of firms and offshoring of manufacturing to reduce costs. Companies such as Verizon and AT&T have taken advantage of fiber-optic communications to deliver a variety of high-throughput data and broadband services to consumers' homes. 
Technology
Modern fiber-optic communication systems generally include optical transmitters that convert electrical signals into optical signals, optical fiber cables to carry the signal, optical amplifiers, and optical receivers to convert the signal back into an electrical signal. The information transmitted is typically digital information generated by computers or telephone systems. 
Transmitters
 A GBIC module (shown here with its cover removed), is an optical and electrical transceiver, a device combining a transmitter and a receiver in a single housing. The electrical connector is at top right and the optical connectors are at bottom left. 
The most commonly used optical transmitters are semiconductor devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes. The difference between LEDs and laser diodes is that LEDs produce incoherent light, while laser diodes produce coherent light. For use in optical communications, semiconductor optical transmitters must be designed to be compact, efficient and reliable, while operating in an optimal wavelength range and directly modulated at high frequencies. 
In its simplest form, an LED emits light through spontaneous emission, a phenomenon referred to as electroluminescence. The emitted light is incoherent with a relatively wide spectral width of 30–60 nm.[a] The large spectrum width of LEDs is subject to higher fiber dispersion, considerably limiting their bit rate-distance product (a common measure of usefulness). LEDs are suitable primarily for local-area-network applications with bit rates of 10–100 Mbit/s and transmission distances of a few kilometers. 
LED light transmission is inefficient, with only about 1% of input power, or about 100 microwatts, eventually converted into launched power coupled into the optical fiber.[28] 
LEDs have been developed that use several quantum wells to emit light at different wavelengths over a broad spectrum and are currently in use for local-area wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) applications. 
LEDs have been largely superseded by vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) devices, which offer improved speed, power and spectral properties, at a similar cost. However, due to their relatively simple design, LEDs are very useful for very low-cost applications. Commonly used classes of semiconductor laser transmitters used in fiber optics include VCSEL, Fabry–Pérot and distributed-feedback laser. 
A semiconductor laser emits light through stimulated emission rather than spontaneous emission, which results in high output power (~100 mW) as well as other benefits related to the nature of coherent light. The output of a laser is relatively directional, allowing high coupling efficiency (~50%) into single-mode fiber. Common VCSEL devices also couple well to multimode fiber. The narrow spectral width also allows for high bit rates since it reduces the effect of chromatic dispersion. Furthermore, semiconductor lasers can be modulated directly at high frequencies because of short recombination time. 
Laser diodes are often directly modulated, that is the light output is controlled by a current applied directly to the device. For very high data rates or very long distance links, a laser source may be operated continuous wave, and the light modulated by an external device, an optical modulator, such as an electro-absorption modulator or Mach–Zehnder interferometer. External modulation increases the achievable link distance by eliminating laser chirp, which broadens the linewidth in directly modulated lasers, increasing the chromatic dispersion in the fiber. For very high bandwidth efficiency, coherent modulation can be used to vary the phase of the light in addition to the amplitude, enabling the use of QPSK, QAM, and OFDM. "Dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying is a modulation format that effectively sends four times as much information as traditional optical transmissions of the same speed."[29] 
Receivers
The main component of an optical receiver is a photodetector which converts light into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The primary photodetectors for telecommunications are made from Indium gallium arsenide. The photodetector is typically a semiconductor-based photodiode. Several types of photodiodes include p–n photodiodes, p–i–n photodiodes, and avalanche photodiodes. Metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors are also used due to their suitability for circuit integration in regenerators and wavelength-division multiplexers. 
Since light may be attenuated and distorted while passing through the fiber, photodetectors are typically coupled with a transimpedance amplifier and a limiting amplifier to produce a digital signal in the electrical domain recovered from the incoming optical signal. Further signal processing such as clock recovery from data performed by a phase-locked loop may also be applied before the data is passed on. 
Coherent receivers use a local oscillator laser in combination with a pair of hybrid couplers and four photodetectors per polarization, followed by high-speed ADCs and digital signal processing to recover data modulated with QPSK, QAM, or OFDM.[citation needed] 
Digital predistortion
An optical communication system transmitter consists of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), a driver amplifier and a Mach–Zehnder modulator. The deployment of higher modulation formats (>4-QAM) or higher baud Rates (>32 GBd) diminishes the system performance due to linear and non-linear transmitter effects. These effects can be categorized as linear distortions due to DAC bandwidth limitation and transmitter I/Q skew as well as non-linear effects caused by gain saturation in the driver amplifier and the Mach–Zehnder modulator. Digital predistortion counteracts the degrading effects and enables Baud rates up to 56 GBd and modulation formats like 64-QAM and 128-QAM with the commercially available components. The transmitter digital signal processor performs digital predistortion on the input signals using the inverse transmitter model before sending the samples to the DAC. 
Older digital predistortion methods only addressed linear effects. Recent publications also consider non-linear distortions. Berenguer et al models the Mach–Zehnder modulator as an independent Wiener system and the DAC and the driver amplifier are modeled by a truncated, time-invariant Volterra series.[30] Khanna et al use a memory polynomial to model the transmitter components jointly.[31] In both approaches the Volterra series or the memory polynomial coefficients are found using indirect-learning architecture. Duthel et al records, for each branch of the Mach-Zehnder modulator, several signals at different polarity and phases. The signals are used to calculate the optical field. Cross-correlating in-phase and quadrature fields identifies the timing skew. The frequency response and the non-linear effects are determined by the indirect-learning architecture.[32] 
Fiber cable types

An optical fiber cable consists of a core, cladding, and a buffer (a protective outer coating), in which the cladding guides the light along the core by using the method of total internal reflection. The core and the cladding (which has a lower-refractive-index) are usually made of high-quality silica glass, although they can both be made of plastic as well. Connecting two optical fibers is done by fusion splicing or mechanical splicing and requires special skills and interconnection technology due to the microscopic precision required to align the fiber cores.[33] 
Two main types of optical fiber used in optic communications include multi-mode optical fibers and single-mode optical fibers. A multi-mode optical fiber has a larger core (≥ 50 micrometers), allowing less precise, cheaper transmitters and receivers to connect to it as well as cheaper connectors. However, a multi-mode fiber introduces multimode distortion, which often limits the bandwidth and length of the link. Furthermore, because of its higher dopant content, multi-mode fibers are usually expensive and exhibit higher attenuation. The core of a single-mode fiber is smaller (< 10 micrometers) and requires more expensive components and interconnection methods, but allows much longer and higher-performance links. Both single- and multi-mode fiber is offered in different grades.

In order to package fiber into a commercially viable product, it typically is protectively coated by using ultraviolet cured acrylate polymers[citation needed] and assembled into a cable. After that, it can be laid in the ground and then run through the walls of a building and deployed aerially in a manner similar to copper cables. These fibers require less maintenance than common twisted pair wires once they are deployed.[35] 
Specialized cables are used for long-distance subsea data transmission, e.g. transatlantic communications cable. New (2011–2013) cables operated by commercial enterprises (Emerald Atlantis, Hibernia Atlantic) typically have four strands of fiber and signals cross the Atlantic (NYC-London) in 60–70 ms. The cost of each such cable was about $300M in 2011.[36] 
Another common practice is to bundle many fiber optic strands within long-distance power transmission cable using, for instance, an optical ground wire. This exploits power transmission rights of way effectively, ensures a power company can own and control the fiber required to monitor its own devices and lines, is effectively immune to tampering, and simplifies the deployment of smart grid technology. 
Amplification
Main article: Optical amplifier
The transmission distance of a fiber-optic communication system has traditionally been limited by fiber attenuation and by fiber distortion. By using optoelectronic repeaters, these problems have been eliminated. These repeaters convert the signal into an electrical signal and then use a transmitter to send the signal again at a higher intensity than was received, thus counteracting the loss incurred in the previous segment. Because of the high complexity with modern wavelength-division multiplexed signals, including the fact that they had to be installed about once every 20 km (12 mi), the cost of these repeaters is very high. 
An alternative approach is to use optical amplifiers which amplify the optical signal directly without having to convert the signal to the electrical domain. One common type of optical amplifier is an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). These are made by doping a length of fiber with the rare-earth mineral erbium and laser pumping it with light with a shorter wavelength than the communications signal (typically 980 nm). EDFAs provide gain in the ITU C band at 1550 nm. 
Optical amplifiers have several significant advantages over electrical repeaters. First, an optical amplifier can amplify a very wide band at once which can include hundreds of multiplexed channels, eliminating the need to demultiplex signals at each amplifier. Second, optical amplifiers operate independently of the data rate and modulation format, enabling multiple data rates and modulation formats to co-exist and enabling upgrading of the data rate of a system without having to replace all of the repeaters. Third, optical amplifiers are much simpler than a repeater with the same capabilities and are therefore significantly more reliable. Optical amplifiers have largely replaced repeaters in new installations, although electronic repeaters are still widely used when signal conditioning beyond amplification is required. 
Wavelength-division multiplexing
Main article: Wavelength-division multiplexing
Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is the technique of transmitting multiple channels of information through a single optical fiber by sending multiple light beams of different wavelengths through the fiber, each modulated with a separate information channel. This allows the available capacity of optical fibers to be multiplied. This requires a wavelength division multiplexer in the transmitting equipment and a demultiplexer (essentially a spectrometer) in the receiving equipment. Arrayed waveguide gratings are commonly used for multiplexing and demultiplexing in WDM.[37] Using WDM technology now commercially available, the bandwidth of a fiber can be divided into as many as 160 channels[38] to support a combined bit rate in the range of 1.6 Tbit/s. 
Parameters
Bandwidth–distance product
Because the effect of dispersion increases with the length of the fiber, a fiber transmission system is often characterized by its bandwidth–distance product, usually expressed in units of MHz•km. This value is a product of bandwidth and distance because there is a trade-off between the bandwidth of the signal and the distance over which it can be carried. For example, a common multi-mode fiber with bandwidth–distance product of 500 MHz•km could carry a 500 MHz signal for 1 km or a 1000 MHz signal for 0.5 km. 
Record speeds
Using wavelength-division multiplexing, each fiber can carry many independent channels, each using a different wavelength of light. The net data rate (data rate without overhead bytes) per fiber is the per-channel data rate reduced by the forward error correction (FEC) overhead, multiplied by the number of channels (usually up to eighty in commercial dense WDM systems as of 2008).[needs update]

Research conducted by the RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia, have developed a nanophotonic device that carries data on light waves that have been twisted into a spiral form and achieved a 100-fold increase in current attainable fiber optic speeds.[75] The technique is known as orbital angular momentum (OAM). The nanophotonic device uses ultra-thin sheets to measure a fraction of a millimeter of twisted light. Nano-electronic device is embedded within a connector smaller than the size of a USB connector and may be fitted at the end of an optical fiber cable.[76] 
Dispersion
For modern glass optical fiber, the maximum transmission distance is limited not by direct material absorption but by dispersion, the spreading of optical pulses as they travel along the fiber. Dispersion limits the bandwidth of the fiber because the spreading optical pulse limits the rate which pulses can follow one another on the fiber and still be distinguishable at the receiver. Dispersion in optical fibers is caused by a variety of factors. 
Intermodal dispersion, caused by the different axial speeds of different transverse modes, limits the performance of multi-mode fiber. Because single-mode fiber supports only one transverse mode, intermodal dispersion is eliminated. 
In single-mode fiber performance is primarily limited by chromatic dispersion, which occurs because the index of the glass varies slightly depending on the wavelength of the light, and, due to modulation, light from optical transmitters necessarily occupies a (narrow) range of wavelengths. Polarization mode dispersion, another source of limitation, occurs because although the single-mode fiber can sustain only one transverse mode, it can carry this mode with two different polarizations, and slight imperfections or distortions in a fiber can alter the propagation velocities for the two polarizations. This phenomenon is called birefringence and can be counteracted by polarization-maintaining optical fiber. 
Some dispersion, notably chromatic dispersion, can be removed by a dispersion compensator. This works by using a specially prepared length of fiber that has the opposite dispersion to that induced by the transmission fiber, and this sharpens the pulse so that it can be correctly decoded by the electronics. 
Attenuation
Fiber attenuation is caused by a combination of material absorption, Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering, and losses in connectors. Material absorption for pure silica is only around 0.03 dB/km. Impurities in early optical fibers caused attenuation of about 1000 dB/km. Modern fiber has attenuation around 0.3 dB/km. Other forms of attenuation are caused by physical stresses to the fiber, microscopic fluctuations in density, and imperfect splicing techniques.[77] 
Transmission windows 
"Optical band" redirects here. Not to be confused with Optical spectrum.
Each effect that contributes to attenuation and dispersion depends on the optical wavelength. There are wavelength bands (or windows) where these effects are weakest, and these are the most favorable for transmission. These windows have been standardized.[78] 
Standard bands for optical fiber communications 
Band 	Description 	Wavelength range 
O band 	Original 	1260–1360 nm 
E band 	Extended 	1360–1460 nm 
S band 	Short wavelengths 	1460–1530 nm 
C band 	Conventional (erbium window) 	1530–1565 nm 
L band 	Long wavelengths 	1565–1625 nm 
U band 	Ultralong wavelengths 	1625–1675 nm 
Note that this table shows that current technology has managed to bridge the E and S windows that were originally disjoint. 
Historically, there was a window of wavelengths shorter than O band, called the first window, at 800–900 nm; however, losses are high in this region so this window is used primarily for short-distance communications. The current lower windows (O and E) around 1300 nm have much lower losses. This region has zero dispersion. The middle windows (S and C) around 1500 nm are the most widely used. This region has the lowest attenuation losses and achieves the longest range. It does have some dispersion, so dispersion compensator devices are used to address this. 
Regeneration
When a communications link must span a larger distance than existing fiber-optic technology is capable of, the signal must be regenerated at intermediate points in the link by optical communications repeaters. Repeaters add substantial cost to a communication system, and so system designers attempt to minimize their use. 
Recent advances in fiber and optical communications technology have reduced signal degradation to the point that regeneration of the optical signal is only needed over distances of hundreds of kilometers. This has greatly reduced the cost of optical networking, particularly over undersea spans where the cost and reliability of repeaters is one of the key factors determining the performance of the whole cable system. The main advances contributing to these performance improvements are dispersion management, which seeks to balance the effects of dispersion against non-linearity; and solitons, which use nonlinear effects in the fiber to enable dispersion-free propagation over long distances. 
Last mile
Although fiber-optic systems excel in high-bandwidth applications, the last mile problem remains unsolved as fiber to the premises has experienced slow uptake. However, fiber to the home (FTTH) deployment has accelerated. In Japan, for instance EPON has largely replaced DSL as a broadband Internet source. The largest FTTH deployments are in Japan, South Korea, and China. Singapore started implementation of their all-fiber Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (Next Gen NBN), which is slated for completion in 2012 and is being installed by OpenNet. Since they began rolling out services in September 2010, network coverage in Singapore has reached 85% nationwide.[needs update] 
In the US, Verizon Communications provides a FTTH service called FiOS to selected high-average-revenue-per-user markets within its existing territory. The other major surviving incumbent local exchange carrier, AT&T, uses a fiber to the node (FTTN) service called U-verse with twisted-pair to the home. Their MSO competitors employ FTTN with coax using hybrid fiber-coaxial networks. All of the major access networks use fiber for the bulk of the distance from the service provider's network to the customer. 
The globally dominant access network technology is Ethernet passive optical network (EPON). In Europe, and among telcos in the United States, ATM-based Broadband PON (BPON) and Gigabit PON (GPON) had roots in the Full Service Access Network (FSAN) and ITU-T standards organizations under their control. 
Comparison with electrical transmission

The choice between optical fiber and electrical (or copper) transmission for a particular system is made based on a number of trade-offs. Optical fiber is generally chosen for systems requiring higher bandwidth, operating in harsh environments or spanning longer distances than electrical cabling can accommodate. 
The main benefits of fiber are its exceptionally low loss (allowing long distances between repeaters), its absence of ground currents and other parasite signal and power issues common to long parallel electric conductor runs (due to its reliance on light rather than electricity for transmission, and the dielectric nature of fiber optic), and its inherently high data-carrying capacity. Thousands of electrical links would be required to replace a single high-bandwidth fiber cable. Another benefit of fibers is that even when run alongside each other for long distances, fiber cables experience effectively no crosstalk, in contrast to some types of electrical transmission lines. Fiber can be installed in areas with high electromagnetic interference (EMI), such as alongside power lines, and railroad tracks. Nonmetallic all-dielectric cables are also ideal for areas of high lightning-strike incidence. 
For comparison, while single-line, voice-grade copper systems longer than a couple of kilometers require in-line signal repeaters for satisfactory performance, it is not unusual for optical systems to go over 100 kilometers (62 mi), with no active or passive processing. 
Optical fibers are more difficult and expensive to splice than electrical conductors. And at higher powers, optical fibers are susceptible to fiber fuse, resulting in catastrophic destruction of the fiber core and damage to transmission components.[79] 
In short-distance and relatively low-bandwidth applications, electrical transmission is often preferred because of its lower cost. Optical communication is not common in short box-to-box, backplane, or chip-to-chip applications. 
In certain situations, fiber may be used even for short-distance or low-bandwidth applications, due to other important features: 
	Immunity to electromagnetic interference, including nuclear electromagnetic pulses.
	High electrical resistance, making it safe to use near high-voltage equipment or between areas with different earth potentials.
	Lighter weight—important, for example, in aircraft.
	No potential for arcing—important in flammable or explosive gas environments.[80]
	Not electromagnetically radiating, and difficult to tap without disrupting the signal—important in high-security environments.
	Much smaller cable size—important where the pathway is limited, such as networking an existing building, where smaller channels can be drilled and space can be saved in existing cable ducts and trays.
	Resistance to corrosion due to non-metallic transmission medium
Optical fiber cables can be installed in buildings using the same equipment that is used to install copper and coaxial cables, with some modifications due to the small size and limited allowable pull tension and bend radius of optical cables. 
Governing standards
In order for various manufacturers to be able to develop components that function compatibly in fiber optic communication systems, a number of standards have been developed. The International Telecommunication Union publishes several standards related to the characteristics and performance of fibers themselves, including 
	ITU-T G.651, "Characteristics of a 50/125 μm multimode graded index optical fibre cable"
	ITU-T G.652, "Characteristics of a single-mode optical fibre cable"
Other standards specify performance criteria for fiber, transmitters, and receivers to be used together in conforming systems. Some of these standards are: 
	100 Gigabit Ethernet
	10 Gigabit Ethernet
	Fibre Channel
	Gigabit Ethernet
	HIPPI
	Synchronous Digital Hierarchy
	Synchronous Optical Networking
	Optical transport network (OTN)
TOSLINK is the most common format for digital audio cable using plastic optical fiber to connect digital sources to digital receivers.

Notes
	
	Communications LEDs are most commonly made from Indium gallium arsenide phosphide (InGaAsP) or gallium arsenide (GaAs). Because InGaAsP LEDs operate at a longer wavelength than GaAs LEDs (1.3 micrometers vs. 0.81–0.87 micrometers), their output spectrum, while equivalent in energy is wider in wavelength terms by a factor of about 1.7.

Digital control is a branch of control theory that uses digital computers to act as system controllers. Depending on the requirements, a digital control system can take the form of a microcontroller to an ASIC to a standard desktop computer. Since a digital computer is a discrete system, the Laplace transform is replaced with the Z-transform. Since a digital computer has finite precision (See quantization), extra care is needed to ensure the error in coefficients, analog-to-digital conversion, digital-to-analog conversion, etc. are not producing undesired or unplanned effects. 
Since the creation of the first digital computer in the early 1940s the price of digital computers has dropped considerably, which has made them key pieces to control systems because they are easy to configure and reconfigure through software, can scale to the limits of the memory or storage space without extra cost, parameters of the program can change with time (See adaptive control) and digital computers are much less prone to environmental conditions than capacitors, inductors, etc. 
Digital controller implementation
A digital controller is usually cascaded with the plant in a feedback system. The rest of the system can either be digital or analog. 
Typically, a digital controller requires: 
	Analog-to-digital conversion to convert analog inputs to machine-readable (digital) format
	Digital-to-analog conversion to convert digital outputs to a form that can be input to a plant (analog)
	A program that relates the outputs to the inputs
Output program
	Outputs from the digital controller are functions of current and past input samples, as well as past output samples - this can be implemented by storing relevant values of input and output in registers. The output can then be formed by a weighted sum of these stored values.
The programs can take numerous forms and perform many functions 
	A digital filter for low-pass filtering
	A state space model of a system to act as a state observer
	A telemetry system
Stability
Although a controller may be stable when implemented as an analog controller, it could be unstable when implemented as a digital controller due to a large sampling interval. During sampling the aliasing modifies the cutoff parameters. Thus the sample rate characterizes the transient response and stability of the compensated system, and must update the values at the controller input often enough so as to not cause instability. 
When substituting the frequency into the z operator, regular stability criteria still apply to discrete control systems. Nyquist criteria apply to z-domain transfer functions as well as being general for complex valued functions. Bode stability criteria apply similarly. Jury criterion determines the discrete system stability about its characteristic polynomial. 
Design of digital controller in s-domain
The digital controller can also be designed in the s-domain (continuous). The Tustin transformation can transform the continuous compensator to the respective digital compensator. The digital compensator will achieve an output that approaches the output of its respective analog controller as the sampling interval is decreased. 
 
Tustin transformation deduction
Tustin is the Padé(1,1) approximation of the exponential function   : 
 
And its inverse 
 
Digital control theory is the technique to design strategies in discrete time, (and/or) quantized amplitude (and/or) in (binary) coded form to be implemented in computer systems (microcontrollers, microprocessors) that will control the analog (continuous in time and amplitude) dynamics of analog systems. From this consideration many errors from classical digital control were identified and solved and new methods were proposed: 
	Marcelo Tredinnick and Marcelo Souza and their new type of analog-digital mapping[1][2][3]
	Yutaka Yamamoto and his "lifting function space model"[4]
	Alexander Sesekin and his studies about impulsive systems.[5]
	M.U. Akhmetov and his studies about impulsive and pulse control[6]
Design of digital controller in z-domain
The digital controller can also be designed in the z-domain (discrete). The Pulse Transfer Function (PTF)  represents the digital viewpoint of the continuous process  when interfaced with appropriate ADC and DAC, and for a specified sample time  is obtained as:[7] 
 
Where  denotes z-Transform for the chosen sample time  . There are many ways to directly design a digital controller  to achieve a given specification.[7] For a type-0 system under unity negative feedback control, Michael Short and colleagues have shown that a relatively simple but effective method to synthesize a controller for a given (monic) closed-loop denominator polynomial  and preserve the (scaled) zeros of the PTF numerator  is to use the design equation:[8] 
 
Where the scalar term  ensures the controller  exhibits integral action, and a steady-state gain of unity is achieved in the closed-loop. The resulting closed-loop discrete transfer function from the z-Transform of reference input  to the z-Transform of process output  is then given by:[8] 
 
Since process time delay manifests as leading co-efficient(s) of zero in the process PTF numerator  , the synthesis method above inherently yields a predictive controller if any such delay is present in the continuous plant.[8]

 Texas Instruments TMS1000  Intel 4004  Motorola 6800 (MC6800)  A modern 64-bit x86-64 processor (AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7970X, based on Zen 4, 2023)  AMD Ryzen 7 1800X (2017, based on Zen) processor in an AM4 socket on a motherboard 
A microprocessor is a computer processor for which the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit (IC), or a small number of ICs. The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). The IC is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations.[1] The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results (also in binary form) as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic, and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system. 
The integration of a whole CPU onto a single or a few integrated circuits using Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) greatly reduced the cost of processing power. Integrated circuit processors are produced in large numbers by highly automated metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) fabrication processes, resulting in a relatively low unit price. Single-chip processors increase reliability because there are fewer electrical connections that can fail. As microprocessor designs improve, the cost of manufacturing a chip (with smaller components built on a semiconductor chip the same size) generally stays the same according to Rock's law. 
Before microprocessors, small computers had been built using racks of circuit boards with many medium- and small-scale integrated circuits, typically of TTL type. Microprocessors combined this into one or a few large-scale ICs. While there is disagreement over who deserves credit for the invention of the microprocessor, the first commercially available microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed by Federico Faggin and introduced in 1971.[2] 
Continued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete (see history of computing hardware), with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest embedded systems and handheld devices to the largest mainframes and supercomputers. 
A microprocessor is distinct from a microcontroller including a system on a chip.[3][4] A microprocessor is related but distinct from a digital signal processor, a specialized microprocessor chip, with its architecture optimized for the operational needs of digital signal processing.[5]: 104–107 [6] 
Structure
 A block diagram of the architecture of the Z80 microprocessor, showing the arithmetic and logic section, register file, control logic section, and buffers to external address and data lines 
The complexity of an integrated circuit is bounded by physical limitations on the number of transistors that can be put onto one chip, the number of package terminations that can connect the processor to other parts of the system, the number of interconnections it is possible to make on the chip, and the heat that the chip can dissipate. Advancing technology makes more complex and powerful chips feasible to manufacture. 
A minimal hypothetical microprocessor might include only an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and a control logic section. The ALU performs addition, subtraction, and operations such as AND or OR. Each operation of the ALU sets one or more flags in a status register, which indicate the results of the last operation (zero value, negative number, overflow, or others). The control logic retrieves instruction codes from memory and initiates the sequence of operations required for the ALU to carry out the instruction. A single operation code might affect many individual data paths, registers, and other elements of the processor. 
As integrated circuit technology advanced, it was feasible to manufacture more and more complex processors on a single chip. The size of data objects became larger; allowing more transistors on a chip allowed word sizes to increase from 4- and 8-bit words up to today's 64-bit words. Additional features were added to the processor architecture; more on-chip registers sped up programs, and complex instructions could be used to make more compact programs. Floating-point arithmetic, for example, was often not available on 8-bit microprocessors, but had to be carried out in software. Integration of the floating-point unit, first as a separate integrated circuit and then as part of the same microprocessor chip, sped up floating-point calculations. 
Occasionally, physical limitations of integrated circuits made such practices as a bit slice approach necessary. Instead of processing all of a long word on one integrated circuit, multiple circuits in parallel processed subsets of each word. While this required extra logic to handle, for example, carry and overflow within each slice, the result was a system that could handle, for example, 32-bit words using integrated circuits with a capacity for only four bits each. 
The ability to put large numbers of transistors on one chip makes it feasible to integrate memory on the same die as the processor. This CPU cache has the advantage of faster access than off-chip memory and increases the processing speed of the system for many applications. Processor clock frequency has increased more rapidly than external memory speed, so cache memory is necessary if the processor is not to be delayed by slower external memory. 
The design of some processors has become complicated enough to be difficult to fully test, and this has caused problems at large cloud providers.[7] 
Special-purpose designs
A microprocessor is a general purpose processing entity. Several specialized processing devices have followed: 
	A digital signal processor (DSP) is specialized for signal processing.
	Graphics processing units (GPUs) are processors designed primarily for real-time rendering of images.
	Other specialized units exist for video processing and machine vision. (See: Hardware acceleration.)
	Microcontrollers in embedded systems and peripheral devices.
	Systems on chip (SoCs) often integrate one or more microprocessor and microcontroller cores with other components such as radio modems, and are used in smartphones and tablet computers.
Speed and power considerations
 Intel Core i9-9900K (2018, based on Coffee Lake) 
Microprocessors can be selected for differing applications based on their word size, which is a measure of their complexity. Longer word sizes allow each clock cycle of a processor to carry out more computation, but correspond to physically larger integrated circuit dies with higher standby and operating power consumption.[8] 4-, 8- or 12-bit processors are widely integrated into microcontrollers operating embedded systems. Where a system is expected to handle larger volumes of data or require a more flexible user interface, 16-, 32- or 64-bit processors are used. An 8- or 16-bit processor may be selected over a 32-bit processor for system on a chip or microcontroller applications that require extremely low-power electronics, or are part of a mixed-signal integrated circuit with noise-sensitive on-chip analog electronics such as high-resolution analog to digital converters, or both. Some people say that running 32-bit arithmetic on an 8-bit chip could end up using more power, as the chip must execute software with multiple instructions.[9] However, others say that modern 8-bit chips are always more power-efficient than 32-bit chips when running equivalent software routines.[10] 
Embedded applications
Thousands of items that were traditionally not computer-related include microprocessors. These include household appliances, vehicles (and their accessories), tools and test instruments, toys, light switches/dimmers and electrical circuit breakers, smoke alarms, battery packs, and hi-fi audio/visual components (from DVD players to phonograph turntables). Such products as cellular telephones, DVD video system and HDTV broadcast systems fundamentally require consumer devices with powerful, low-cost, microprocessors. Increasingly stringent pollution control standards effectively require automobile manufacturers to use microprocessor engine management systems to allow optimal control of emissions over the widely varying operating conditions of an automobile. Non-programmable controls would require bulky, or costly implementation to achieve the results possible with a microprocessor. 
A microprocessor control program (embedded software) can be tailored to fit the needs of a product line, allowing upgrades in performance with minimal redesign of the product. Unique features can be implemented in product line's various models at negligible production cost. 
Microprocessor control of a system can provide control strategies that would be impractical to implement using electromechanical controls or purpose-built electronic controls. For example, an internal combustion engine's control system can adjust ignition timing based on engine speed, load, temperature, and any observed tendency for knocking—allowing the engine to operate on a range of fuel grades. 
History
See also: Microprocessor chronology
The advent of low-cost computers on integrated circuits has transformed modern society. General-purpose microprocessors in personal computers are used for computation, text editing, multimedia display, and communication over the Internet. Many more microprocessors are part of embedded systems, providing digital control over myriad objects from appliances to automobiles to cellular phones and industrial process control. Microprocessors perform binary operations based on Boolean logic, named after George Boole. The ability to operate computer systems using Boolean Logic was first proven in a 1938 thesis by master's student Claude Shannon, who later went on to become a professor. Shannon is considered "The Father of Information Theory". In 1951 Microprogramming was invented by Maurice Wilkes at the University of Cambridge, UK, from the realisation that the central processor could be controlled by a specialised program in a dedicated ROM.[11] Wilkes is also credited with the idea of symbolic labels, macros and subroutine libraries.[12] 
Following the development of MOS integrated circuit chips in the early 1960s, MOS chips reached higher transistor density and lower manufacturing costs than bipolar integrated circuits by 1964. MOS chips further increased in complexity at a rate predicted by Moore's law, leading to large-scale integration (LSI) with hundreds of transistors on a single MOS chip by the late 1960s. The application of MOS LSI chips to computing was the basis for the first microprocessors, as engineers began recognizing that a complete computer processor could be contained on several MOS LSI chips.[13] Designers in the late 1960s were striving to integrate the central processing unit (CPU) functions of a computer onto a handful of MOS LSI chips, called microprocessor unit (MPU) chipsets. 
While there is disagreement over who invented the microprocessor,[2][14] the first commercially available microprocessor was the Intel 4004, released as a single MOS LSI chip in 1971.[15] The single-chip microprocessor was made possible with the development of MOS silicon-gate technology (SGT).[16] The earliest MOS transistors had aluminium metal gates, which Italian physicist Federico Faggin replaced with silicon self-aligned gates to develop the first silicon-gate MOS chip at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968.[16] Faggin later joined Intel and used his silicon-gate MOS technology to develop the 4004, along with Marcian Hoff, Stanley Mazor and Masatoshi Shima in 1971.[17] The 4004 was designed for Busicom, which had earlier proposed a multi-chip design in 1969, before Faggin's team at Intel changed it into a new single-chip design. Intel introduced the first commercial microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004, in 1971. It was soon followed by the 8-bit microprocessor Intel 8008 in 1972. The MP944 chipset used in the F-14 Central Air Data Computer in 1970 has also been cited as an early microprocessor, but was not known to the public until declassified in 1998. 
Other embedded uses of 4-bit and 8-bit microprocessors, such as terminals, printers, various kinds of automation etc., followed soon after. Affordable 8-bit microprocessors with 16-bit addressing also led to the first general-purpose microcomputers from the mid-1970s on. 
The first use of the term "microprocessor" is attributed to Viatron Computer Systems[18] describing the custom integrated circuit used in their System 21 small computer system announced in 1968. 
Since the early 1970s, the increase in capacity of microprocessors has followed Moore's law; this originally suggested that the number of components that can be fitted onto a chip doubles every year. With present technology, it is actually every two years,[19] [obsolete source] and as a result Moore later changed the period to two years.[20] 
First projects
These projects delivered a microprocessor at about the same time: Garrett AiResearch's Central Air Data Computer (CADC) (1970), Texas Instruments' TMS 1802NC (September 1971) and Intel's 4004 (November 1971, based on an earlier 1969 Busicom design). Arguably, Four-Phase Systems AL1 microprocessor was also delivered in 1969. 
Four-Phase Systems AL1 (1969)
The Four-Phase Systems AL1 was an 8-bit bit slice chip containing eight registers and an ALU.[21] It was designed by Lee Boysel in 1969.[22][23][24] At the time, it formed part of a nine-chip, 24-bit CPU with three AL1s. It was later called a microprocessor when, in response to 1990s litigation by Texas Instruments, Boysel constructed a demonstration system where a single AL1 formed part of a courtroom demonstration computer system, together with RAM, ROM, and an input-output device.[25]

Further information: F-14 CADC
In 1968, Garrett AiResearch (who employed designers Ray Holt and Steve Geller) was invited to produce a digital computer to compete with electromechanical systems then under development for the main flight control computer in the US Navy's new F-14 Tomcat fighter. The design was complete by 1970, and used a MOS-based chipset as the core CPU. The design was significantly (approximately 20 times) smaller and much more reliable than the mechanical systems it competed against and was used in all of the early Tomcat models. This system contained "a 20-bit, pipelined, parallel multi-microprocessor". The Navy refused to allow publication of the design until 1997. Released in 1998, the documentation on the CADC, and the MP944 chipset, are well known. Ray Holt's autobiographical story of this design and development is presented in the book: The Accidental Engineer.[26][27] 
Ray Holt graduated from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona in 1968, and began his computer design career with the CADC.[28] From its inception, it was shrouded in secrecy until 1998 when at Holt's request, the US Navy allowed the documents into the public domain. Holt has claimed that no one has compared this microprocessor with those that came later.[29] According to Parab et al. (2007), 
The scientific papers and literature published around 1971 reveal that the MP944 digital processor used for the F-14 Tomcat aircraft of the US Navy qualifies as the first microprocessor. Although interesting, it was not a single-chip processor, as was not the Intel 4004 – they both were more like a set of parallel building blocks you could use to make a general-purpose form. It contains a CPU, RAM, ROM, and two other support chips like the Intel 4004. It was made from the same P-channel technology, operated at military specifications and had larger chips – an excellent computer engineering design by any standards. Its design indicates a major advance over Intel, and two year earlier. It actually worked and was flying in the F-14 when the Intel 4004 was announced. It indicates that today's industry theme of converging DSP-microcontroller architectures was started in 1971.[30]
This convergence of DSP and microcontroller architectures is known as a digital signal controller.[31] 
Gilbert Hyatt (1970)
In 1990, American engineer Gilbert Hyatt was awarded U.S. Patent No. 4,942,516,[32] which was based on a 16-bit serial computer he built at his Northridge, California, home in 1969 from boards of bipolar chips after quitting his job at Teledyne in 1968;[2][33] though the patent had been submitted in December 1970 and prior to Texas Instruments' filings for the TMX 1795 and TMS 0100, Hyatt's invention was never manufactured.[33][34][35] This nonetheless led to claims that Hyatt was the inventor of the microprocessor and the payment of substantial royalties through a Philips N.V. subsidiary,[36] until Texas Instruments prevailed in a complex legal battle in 1996, when the U.S. Patent Office overturned key parts of the patent, while allowing Hyatt to keep it.[2][37] Hyatt said in a 1990 Los Angeles Times article that his invention would have been created had his prospective investors backed him, and that the venture investors leaked details of his chip to the industry, though he did not elaborate with evidence to support this claim.[33] In the same article, The Chip author T.R. Reid was quoted as saying that historians may ultimately place Hyatt as a co-inventor of the microprocessor, in the way that Intel's Noyce and TI's Kilby share credit for the invention of the chip in 1958: "Kilby got the idea first, but Noyce made it practical. The legal ruling finally favored Noyce, but they are considered co-inventors. The same could happen here."[33] Hyatt would go on to fight a decades-long legal battle with the state of California over alleged unpaid taxes on his patent's windfall after 1990, which would culminate in a landmark Supreme Court case addressing states' sovereign immunity in Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt (2019). 
Texas Instruments TMX 1795 (1970–1971)
Along with Intel (who developed the 8008), Texas Instruments developed in 1970–1971 a one-chip CPU replacement for the Datapoint 2200 terminal, the TMX 1795 (later TMC 1795.) Like the 8008, it was rejected by customer Datapoint. According to Gary Boone, the TMX 1795 never reached production. Still it reached a working prototype state at 1971 February 24, therefore it is the world's first 8-bit microprocessor.[38] Since it was built to the same specification, its instruction set was very similar to the Intel 8008.[39][40] 
Texas Instruments TMS 1802NC (1971)
The TMS1802NC was announced September 17, 1971, and implemented a four-function calculator. The TMS1802NC, despite its designation, was not part of the TMS 1000 series; it was later redesignated as part of the TMS 0100 series, which was used in the TI Datamath calculator. Although marketed as a calculator-on-a-chip, the TMS1802NC was fully programmable, including on the chip a CPU with an 11-bit instruction word, 3520 bits (320 instructions) of ROM and 182 bits of RAM.[39][41][40][42] 
Pico/General Instrument (1971)
 The PICO1/GI250 chip introduced in 1971: It was designed by Pico Electronics (Glenrothes, Scotland) and manufactured by General Instrument of Hicksville NY. 
In 1971, Pico Electronics[43] and General Instrument (GI) introduced their first collaboration in ICs, a complete single-chip calculator IC for the Monroe/Litton Royal Digital III calculator. This chip could also arguably lay claim to be one of the first microprocessors or microcontrollers having ROM, RAM and a RISC instruction set on-chip. The layout for the four layers of the PMOS process was hand drawn at x500 scale on mylar film, a significant task at the time given the complexity of the chip. 
Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single-chip calculator ICs. They had significant previous design experience on multiple calculator chipsets with both GI and Marconi-Elliott.[44] The key team members had originally been tasked by Elliott Automation to create an 8-bit computer in MOS and had helped establish a MOS Research Laboratory in Glenrothes, Scotland in 1967. 
Calculators were becoming the largest single market for semiconductors so Pico and GI went on to have significant success in this burgeoning market. GI continued to innovate in microprocessors and microcontrollers with products including the CP1600, IOB1680 and PIC1650.[45] In 1987, the GI Microelectronics business was spun out into the Microchip PIC microcontroller business. 
Intel 4004 (1971)
Main article: Intel 4004
 The 4004 with cover removed (left) and as actually used (right) 
The Intel 4004 is often (falsely) regarded as the first true microprocessor built on a single chip,[46][47] priced at US$60 (equivalent to $450 in 2023).[48] The claim of being the first is definitely false, as the earlier TMS1802NC was also a true microprocessor built on a single chip and the same applies for the - prototype only - 8-bit TMX 1795.[38] The first known advertisement for the 4004 is dated November 15, 1971, and appeared in Electronic News.[citation needed] The microprocessor was designed by a team consisting of Italian engineer Federico Faggin, American engineers Marcian Hoff and Stanley Mazor, and Japanese engineer Masatoshi Shima.[49] 
The project that produced the 4004 originated in 1969, when Busicom, a Japanese calculator manufacturer, asked Intel to build a chipset for high-performance desktop calculators. Busicom's original design called for a programmable chip set consisting of seven different chips. Three of the chips were to make a special-purpose CPU with its program stored in ROM and its data stored in shift register read-write memory. Ted Hoff, the Intel engineer assigned to evaluate the project, believed the Busicom design could be simplified by using dynamic RAM storage for data, rather than shift register memory, and a more traditional general-purpose CPU architecture. Hoff came up with a four-chip architectural proposal: a ROM chip for storing the programs, a dynamic RAM chip for storing data, a simple I/O device, and a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU). Although not a chip designer, he felt the CPU could be integrated into a single chip, but as he lacked the technical know-how the idea remained just a wish for the time being. 
 First microprocessor by Intel, the 4004 
While the architecture and specifications of the MCS-4 came from the interaction of Hoff with Stanley Mazor, a software engineer reporting to him, and with Busicom engineer Masatoshi Shima, during 1969, Mazor and Hoff moved on to other projects. In April 1970, Intel hired Italian engineer Federico Faggin as project leader, a move that ultimately made the single-chip CPU final design a reality (Shima meanwhile designed the Busicom calculator firmware and assisted Faggin during the first six months of the implementation). Faggin, who originally developed the silicon gate technology (SGT) in 1968 at Fairchild Semiconductor[50] and designed the world's first commercial integrated circuit using SGT, the Fairchild 3708, had the correct background to lead the project into what would become the first commercial general purpose microprocessor. Since SGT was his very own invention, Faggin also used it to create his new methodology for random logic design that made it possible to implement a single-chip CPU with the proper speed, power dissipation and cost. The manager of Intel's MOS Design Department was Leslie L. Vadász at the time of the MCS-4 development but Vadász's attention was completely focused on the mainstream business of semiconductor memories so he left the leadership and the management of the MCS-4 project to Faggin, who was ultimately responsible for leading the 4004 project to its realization. Production units of the 4004 were first delivered to Busicom in March 1971 and shipped to other customers in late 1971.[citation needed]

The Intel 4004 was followed in 1972 by the Intel 8008, intel's first 8-bit microprocessor.[51] The 8008 was not, however, an extension of the 4004 design, but instead the culmination of a separate design project at Intel, arising from a contract with Computer Terminals Corporation, of San Antonio TX, for a chip for a terminal they were designing,[52] the Datapoint 2200—fundamental aspects of the design came not from Intel but from CTC. In 1968, CTC's Vic Poor and Harry Pyle developed the original design for the instruction set and operation of the processor. In 1969, CTC contracted two companies, Intel and Texas Instruments, to make a single-chip implementation, known as the CTC 1201.[53] In late 1970 or early 1971, TI dropped out being unable to make a reliable part. In 1970, with Intel yet to deliver the part, CTC opted to use their own implementation in the Datapoint 2200, using traditional TTL logic instead (thus the first machine to run "8008 code" was not in fact a microprocessor at all and was delivered a year earlier). Intel's version of the 1201 microprocessor arrived in late 1971, but was too late, slow, and required a number of additional support chips. CTC had no interest in using it. CTC had originally contracted Intel for the chip, and would have owed them US$50,000 (equivalent to $376,171 in 2023) for their design work.[53] To avoid paying for a chip they did not want (and could not use), CTC released Intel from their contract and allowed them free use of the design.[53] Intel marketed it as the 8008 in April, 1972, as the world's first 8-bit microprocessor. It was the basis for the famous "Mark-8" computer kit advertised in the magazine Radio-Electronics in 1974. This processor had an 8-bit data bus and a 14-bit address bus.[54] 
The 8008 was the precursor to the successful Intel 8080 (1974), which offered improved performance over the 8008 and required fewer support chips. Federico Faggin conceived and designed it using high voltage N channel MOS. The Zilog Z80 (1976) was also a Faggin design, using low voltage N channel with depletion load and derivative Intel 8-bit processors: all designed with the methodology Faggin created for the 4004. Motorola released the competing 6800 in August 1974, and the similar MOS Technology 6502 was released in 1975 (both designed largely by the same people). The 6502 family rivaled the Z80 in popularity during the 1980s. 
A low overall cost, little packaging, simple computer bus requirements, and sometimes the integration of extra circuitry (e.g. the Z80's built-in memory refresh circuitry) allowed the home computer "revolution" to accelerate sharply in the early 1980s. This delivered such inexpensive machines as the Sinclair ZX81, which sold for US$99 (equivalent to $331.79 in 2023). A variation of the 6502, the MOS Technology 6510 was used in the Commodore 64 and yet another variant, the 8502, powered the Commodore 128. 
The Western Design Center, Inc (WDC) introduced the CMOS WDC 65C02 in 1982 and licensed the design to several firms. It was used as the CPU in the Apple IIe and IIc personal computers as well as in medical implantable grade pacemakers and defibrillators, automotive, industrial and consumer devices. WDC pioneered the licensing of microprocessor designs, later followed by ARM (32-bit) and other microprocessor intellectual property (IP) providers in the 1990s. 
Motorola introduced the MC6809 in 1978. It was an ambitious and well thought-through 8-bit design that was source compatible with the 6800, and implemented using purely hard-wired logic (subsequent 16-bit microprocessors typically used microcode to some extent, as CISC design requirements were becoming too complex for pure hard-wired logic). 
Another early 8-bit microprocessor was the Signetics 2650, which enjoyed a brief surge of interest due to its innovative and powerful instruction set architecture. 
A seminal microprocessor in the world of spaceflight was RCA's RCA 1802 (aka CDP1802, RCA COSMAC) (introduced in 1976), which was used on board the Galileo probe to Jupiter (launched 1989, arrived 1995). RCA COSMAC was the first to implement CMOS technology. The CDP1802 was used because it could be run at very low power, and because a variant was available fabricated using a special production process, silicon on sapphire (SOS), which provided much better protection against cosmic radiation and electrostatic discharge than that of any other processor of the era. Thus, the SOS version of the 1802 was said to be the first radiation-hardened microprocessor. 
The RCA 1802 had a static design, meaning that the clock frequency could be made arbitrarily low, or even stopped. This let the Galileo spacecraft use minimum electric power for long uneventful stretches of a voyage. Timers or sensors would awaken the processor in time for important tasks, such as navigation updates, attitude control, data acquisition, and radio communication. Current versions of the Western Design Center 65C02 and 65C816 also have static cores, and thus retain data even when the clock is completely halted. 
12-bit designs
The Intersil 6100 family consisted of a 12-bit microprocessor (the 6100) and a range of peripheral support and memory ICs. The microprocessor recognised the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer instruction set. As such it was sometimes referred to as the CMOS-PDP8. Since it was also produced by Harris Corporation, it was also known as the Harris HM-6100. By virtue of its CMOS technology and associated benefits, the 6100 was being incorporated into some military designs until the early 1980s.

The first multi-chip 16-bit microprocessor was the National Semiconductor IMP-16, introduced in early 1973. An 8-bit version of the chipset was introduced in 1974 as the IMP-8. 
Other early multi-chip 16-bit microprocessors include the MCP-1600 that Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) used in the LSI-11 OEM board set and the packaged PDP-11/03 minicomputer—and the Fairchild Semiconductor MicroFlame 9440, both introduced in 1975–76. In late 1974, National introduced the first 16-bit single-chip microprocessor, the National Semiconductor PACE,[55] which was later followed by an NMOS version, the INS8900. 
Next in list is the General Instrument CP1600, released in February 1975,[56] which was used mainly in the Intellivision console. 
Another early single-chip 16-bit microprocessor was TI's TMS 9900, which was also compatible with their TI-990 line of minicomputers. The 9900 was used in the TI 990/4 minicomputer, the TI-99/4A home computer, and the TM990 line of OEM microcomputer boards. The chip was packaged in a large ceramic 64-pin DIP package, while most 8-bit microprocessors such as the Intel 8080 used the more common, smaller, and less expensive plastic 40-pin DIP. A follow-on chip, the TMS 9980, was designed to compete with the Intel 8080, had the full TI 990 16-bit instruction set, used a plastic 40-pin package, moved data 8 bits at a time, but could only address 16 KB. A third chip, the TMS 9995, was a new design. The family later expanded to include the 99105 and 99110. 
The Western Design Center (WDC) introduced the CMOS 65816 16-bit upgrade of the WDC CMOS 65C02 in 1984. The 65816 16-bit microprocessor was the core of the Apple IIGS and later the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, making it one of the most popular 16-bit designs of all time. 
Intel "upsized" their 8080 design into the 16-bit Intel 8086, the first member of the x86 family, which powers most modern PC type computers. Intel introduced the 8086 as a cost-effective way of porting software from the 8080 lines, and succeeded in winning much business on that premise. The 8088, a version of the 8086 that used an 8-bit external data bus, was the microprocessor in the first IBM PC. Intel then released the 80186 and 80188, the 80286 and, in 1985, the 32-bit 80386, cementing their PC market dominance with the processor family's backwards compatibility. The 80186 and 80188 were essentially versions of the 8086 and 8088, enhanced with some onboard peripherals and a few new instructions. Although Intel's 80186 and 80188 were not used in IBM PC type designs,[dubious – discuss] second source versions from NEC, the V20 and V30 frequently were. The 8086 and successors had an innovative but limited method of memory segmentation, while the 80286 introduced a full-featured segmented memory management unit (MMU). The 80386 introduced a flat 32-bit memory model with paged memory management. 
The 16-bit Intel x86 processors up to and including the 80386 do not include floating-point units (FPUs). Intel introduced the 8087, 80187, 80287 and 80387 math coprocessors to add hardware floating-point and transcendental function capabilities to the 8086 through 80386 CPUs. The 8087 works with the 8086/8088 and 80186/80188,[57] the 80187 works with the 80186 but not the 80188,[58] the 80287 works with the 80286 and the 80387 works with the 80386. The combination of an x86 CPU and an x87 coprocessor forms a single multi-chip microprocessor; the two chips are programmed as a unit using a single integrated instruction set.[59] The 8087 and 80187 coprocessors are connected in parallel with the data and address buses of their parent processor and directly execute instructions intended for them. The 80287 and 80387 coprocessors are interfaced to the CPU through I/O ports in the CPU's address space, this is transparent to the program, which does not need to know about or access these I/O ports directly; the program accesses the coprocessor and its registers through normal instruction opcodes. 
32-bit designs
 Upper interconnect layers on an Intel 80486DX2 die 
16-bit designs had only been on the market briefly when 32-bit implementations started to appear. 
The most significant of the 32-bit designs is the Motorola MC68000, introduced in 1979. The 68k, as it was widely known, had 32-bit registers in its programming model but used 16-bit internal data paths, three 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Units, and a 16-bit external data bus (to reduce pin count), and externally supported only 24-bit addresses (internally it worked with full 32 bit addresses). In PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes the MC68000 internal microcode was modified to emulate the 32-bit System/370 IBM mainframe.[60] Motorola generally described it as a 16-bit processor. The combination of high performance, large (16 megabytes or 224 bytes) memory space and fairly low cost made it the most popular CPU design of its class. The Apple Lisa and Macintosh designs made use of the 68000, as did other designs in the mid-1980s, including the Atari ST and Amiga. 
The world's first single-chip fully 32-bit microprocessor, with 32-bit data paths, 32-bit buses, and 32-bit addresses, was the AT&T Bell Labs BELLMAC-32A, with first samples in 1980, and general production in 1982.[61][62] After the divestiture of AT&T in 1984, it was renamed the WE 32000 (WE for Western Electric), and had two follow-on generations, the WE 32100 and WE 32200. These microprocessors were used in the AT&T 3B5 and 3B15 minicomputers; in the 3B2, the world's first desktop super microcomputer; in the "Companion", the world's first 32-bit laptop computer; and in "Alexander", the world's first book-sized super microcomputer, featuring ROM-pack memory cartridges similar to today's gaming consoles. All these systems ran the UNIX System V operating system. 
The first commercial, single chip, fully 32-bit microprocessor available on the market was the HP FOCUS. 
Intel's first 32-bit microprocessor was the iAPX 432, which was introduced in 1981, but was not a commercial success. It had an advanced capability-based object-oriented architecture, but poor performance compared to contemporary architectures such as Intel's own 80286 (introduced 1982), which was almost four times as fast on typical benchmark tests. However, the results for the iAPX432 was partly due to a rushed and therefore suboptimal Ada compiler.[citation needed] 
Motorola's success with the 68000 led to the MC68010, which added virtual memory support. The MC68020, introduced in 1984 added full 32-bit data and address buses. The 68020 became hugely popular in the Unix supermicrocomputer market, and many small companies (e.g., Altos, Charles River Data Systems, Cromemco) produced desktop-size systems. The MC68030 was introduced next, improving upon the previous design by integrating the MMU into the chip. The continued success led to the MC68040, which included an FPU for better math performance. The 68050 failed to achieve its performance goals and was not released, and the follow-up MC68060 was released into a market saturated by much faster RISC designs. The 68k family faded from use in the early 1990s. 
Other large companies designed the 68020 and follow-ons into embedded equipment. At one point, there were more 68020s in embedded equipment than there were Intel Pentiums in PCs.[63] The ColdFire processor cores are derivatives of the 68020. 
During this time (early to mid-1980s), National Semiconductor introduced a very similar 16-bit pinout, 32-bit internal microprocessor called the NS 16032 (later renamed 32016), the full 32-bit version named the NS 32032. Later, National Semiconductor produced the NS 32132, which allowed two CPUs to reside on the same memory bus with built in arbitration. The NS32016/32 outperformed the MC68000/10, but the NS32332—which arrived at approximately the same time as the MC68020—did not have enough performance. The third generation chip, the NS32532, was different. It had about double the performance of the MC68030, which was released around the same time. The appearance of RISC processors like the AM29000 and MC88000 (now both dead) influenced the architecture of the final core, the NS32764. Technically advanced—with a superscalar RISC core, 64-bit bus, and internally overclocked—it could still execute Series 32000 instructions through real-time translation. 
When National Semiconductor decided to leave the Unix market, the chip was redesigned into the Swordfish Embedded processor with a set of on-chip peripherals. The chip turned out to be too expensive for the laser printer market and was killed. The design team went to Intel and there designed the Pentium processor, which is very similar to the NS32764 core internally. The big success of the Series 32000 was in the laser printer market, where the NS32CG16 with microcoded BitBlt instructions had very good price/performance and was adopted by large companies like Canon. By the mid-1980s, Sequent introduced the first SMP server-class computer using the NS 32032. This was one of the design's few wins, and it disappeared in the late 1980s. The MIPS R2000 (1984) and R3000 (1989) were highly successful 32-bit RISC microprocessors. They were used in high-end workstations and servers by SGI, among others. Other designs included the Zilog Z80000, which arrived too late to market to stand a chance and disappeared quickly. 
The ARM first appeared in 1985.[64] This is a RISC processor design, which has since come to dominate the 32-bit embedded systems processor space due in large part to its power efficiency, its licensing model, and its wide selection of system development tools. Semiconductor manufacturers generally license cores and integrate them into their own system on a chip products; only a few such vendors such as Apple are licensed to modify the ARM cores or create their own. Most cell phones include an ARM processor, as do a wide variety of other products. There are microcontroller-oriented ARM cores without virtual memory support, as well as symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) applications processors with virtual memory. 
From 1993 to 2003, the 32-bit x86 architectures became increasingly dominant in desktop, laptop, and server markets, and these microprocessors became faster and more capable. Intel had licensed early versions of the architecture to other companies, but declined to license the Pentium, so AMD and Cyrix built later versions of the architecture based on their own designs. During this span, these processors increased in complexity (transistor count) and capability (instructions/second) by at least three orders of magnitude. Intel's Pentium line is probably the most famous and recognizable 32-bit processor model, at least with the public at broad. 
64-bit designs in personal computers
While 64-bit microprocessor designs have been in use in several markets since the early 1990s (including the Nintendo 64 gaming console in 1996), the early 2000s saw the introduction of 64-bit microprocessors targeted at the PC market. 
With AMD's introduction of a 64-bit architecture backwards-compatible with x86, x86-64 (also called AMD64), in September 2003, followed by Intel's near fully compatible 64-bit extensions (first called IA-32e or EM64T, later renamed Intel 64), the 64-bit desktop era began. Both versions can run 32-bit legacy applications without any performance penalty as well as new 64-bit software. With operating systems Windows XP x64, Windows Vista x64, Windows 7 x64, Linux, BSD, and macOS that run 64-bit natively, the software is also geared to fully utilize the capabilities of such processors. The move to 64 bits is more than just an increase in register size from the IA-32 as it also doubles the number of general-purpose registers. 
The move to 64 bits by PowerPC had been intended since the architecture's design in the early 90s and was not a major cause of incompatibility. Existing integer registers are extended as are all related data pathways, but, as was the case with IA-32, both floating-point and vector units had been operating at or above 64 bits for several years. Unlike what happened when IA-32 was extended to x86-64, no new general purpose registers were added in 64-bit PowerPC, so any performance gained when using the 64-bit mode for applications making no use of the larger address space is minimal.[citation needed] 
In 2011, ARM introduced the new 64-bit ARM architecture. 
RISC
Main article: Reduced instruction set computer
In the mid-1980s to early 1990s, a crop of new high-performance reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessors appeared, influenced by discrete RISC-like CPU designs such as the IBM 801 and others. RISC microprocessors were initially used in special-purpose machines and Unix workstations, but then gained wide acceptance in other roles. 
The first commercial RISC microprocessor design was released in 1984, by MIPS Computer Systems, the 32-bit R2000 (the R1000 was not released). In 1986, HP released its first system with a PA-RISC CPU. In 1987, in the non-Unix Acorn computers' 32-bit, then cache-less, ARM2-based Acorn Archimedes became the first commercial success using the ARM architecture, then known as Acorn RISC Machine (ARM); first silicon ARM1 in 1985. The R3000 made the design truly practical, and the R4000 introduced the world's first commercially available 64-bit RISC microprocessor. Competing projects would result in the IBM POWER and Sun SPARC architectures. Soon every major vendor was releasing a RISC design, including the AT&T CRISP, AMD 29000, Intel i860 and Intel i960, Motorola 88000, DEC Alpha. 
In the late 1990s, only two 64-bit RISC architectures were still produced in volume for non-embedded applications: SPARC and Power ISA, but as ARM has become increasingly powerful, in the early 2010s, it became the third RISC architecture in the general computing segment. 
SMP and multi-core design

SMP symmetric multiprocessing[65] is a configuration of two, four, or more CPU's (in pairs) that are typically used in servers, certain workstations and in desktop personal computers, since the 1990s. A multi-core processor is a single CPU that contains more than one microprocessor core. 
This popular two-socket motherboard from Abit was released in 1999 as the first SMP enabled PC motherboard, the Intel Pentium Pro was the first commercial CPU offered to system builders and enthusiasts. The Abit BP9 supports two Intel Celeron CPU's and when used with a SMP enabled operating system (Windows NT/2000/Linux) many applications obtain much higher performance than a single CPU. The early Celerons are easily overclockable and hobbyists used these relatively inexpensive CPU's clocked as high as 533Mhz - far beyond Intel's specification. After discovering the capacity of these motherboards Intel removed access to the multiplier in later CPU's. 
In 2001 IBM released the POWER4 CPU, it was a processor that was developed over five years of research, began in 1996 using a team of 250 researchers. The effort to accomplish the impossible was buttressed by development of and through—remote-collaboration and assigning younger engineers to work with more experienced engineers. The teams work achieved success with the new microprocessor, Power4. It is a two-in-one CPU that more than doubled performance at half the price of the competition, and a major advance in computing. The business magazine eWeek wrote: "The newly designed 1GHz Power4 represents a tremendous leap over its predecessor". An industry analyst, Brad Day of Giga Information Group said: "IBM is getting very aggressive, and this server is a game changer". 
The Power4 won "Analysts’ Choice Award for Best Workstation/Server Processor of 2001", and it broke notable records, including winning a contest against the best players on the Jeopardy![66] U.S. television show. 
Intel's codename Yonah CPU's launched on Jan 6, 2006, and were manufactured with two dies packaged on a multi-chip module. In a hotly-contested marketplace AMD and others released new versions of multi-core CPU's, AMD's SMP enabled Athlon MP CPU's from the AthlonXP line in 2001, Sun released the Niagara and Niagara 2 with eight-cores, AMD's Athlon X2 was released in June 2007. The companies were engaged in a never-ending race for speed, indeed more demanding software mandated more processing power and faster CPU speeds. 
By 2012 dual and quad-core processors became widely used in PCs and laptops, newer processors - similar to the higher cost professional level Intel Xeon's - with additional cores that execute instructions in parallel so software performance typically increases, provided the software is designed to utilize advanced hardware. Operating systems provided support for multiple-cores and SMD CPU's, many software applications including large workload and resource intensive applications - such as 3-D games - are programmed to take advantage of multiple core and multi-CPU systems. 
Apple, Intel, and AMD currently lead the market with multiple core desktop and workstation CPU's. Although they frequently leapfrog each other for the lead in the performance tier. Intel retains higher frequencies and thus has the fastest single core performance,[67] while AMD is often the leader in multi-threaded routines due to a more advanced ISA and the process node the CPU's are fabricated on. 
Multiprocessing concepts for multi-core/multi-cpu configurations are related to Amdahl's law. 
Market statistics
In 1997, about 55% of all CPUs sold in the world were 8-bit microcontrollers, of which over 2 billion were sold.[68] 
In 2002, less than 10% of all the CPUs sold in the world were 32-bit or more. Of all the 32-bit CPUs sold, about 2% are used in desktop or laptop personal computers. Most microprocessors are used in embedded control applications such as household appliances, automobiles, and computer peripherals. Taken as a whole, the average price for a microprocessor, microcontroller, or DSP is just over US$6 (equivalent to $10.16 in 2023).[69] 
In 2003, about $44 billion (equivalent to about $73 billion in 2023) worth of microprocessors were manufactured and sold.[70] Although about half of that money was spent on CPUs used in desktop or laptop personal computers, those count for only about 2% of all CPUs sold.[69] The quality-adjusted price of laptop microprocessors improved −25% to −35% per year in 2004–2010, and the rate of improvement slowed to −15% to −25% per year in 2010–2013.[71] 
About 10 billion CPUs were manufactured in 2008. Most new CPUs produced each year are embedded.[72]

 A computer-simulated realization of a Wiener or Brownian motion process on the surface of a sphere. The Wiener process is widely considered the most studied and central stochastic process in probability theory.[1][2][3] 
In probability theory and related fields, a stochastic (/stəˈkæstɪk/) or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a family of random variables in a probability space, where the index of the family often has the interpretation of time. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. Examples include the growth of a bacterial population, an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise, or the movement of a gas molecule.[1][4][5] Stochastic processes have applications in many disciplines such as biology,[6] chemistry,[7] ecology,[8] neuroscience,[9] physics,[10] image processing, signal processing,[11] control theory,[12] information theory,[13] computer science,[14] and telecommunications.[15] Furthermore, seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance.[16][17][18] 
Applications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic processes include the Wiener process or Brownian motion process,[a] used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse,[21] and the Poisson process, used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time.[22] These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes,[1][4][23] and were invented repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier and Erlang, in different settings and countries.[21][24] 
The term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process,[25][26] because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space.[27][28] The terms stochastic process and random process are used interchangeably, often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables.[27][29] But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line.[5][29] If the random variables are indexed by the Cartesian plane or some higher-dimensional Euclidean space, then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead.[5][30] The values of a stochastic process are not always numbers and can be vectors or other mathematical objects.[5][28] 
Based on their mathematical properties, stochastic processes can be grouped into various categories, which include random walks,[31] martingales,[32] Markov processes,[33] Lévy processes,[34] Gaussian processes,[35] random fields,[36] renewal processes, and branching processes.[37] The study of stochastic processes uses mathematical knowledge and techniques from probability, calculus, linear algebra, set theory, and topology[38][39][40] as well as branches of mathematical analysis such as real analysis, measure theory, Fourier analysis, and functional analysis.[41][42][43] The theory of stochastic processes is considered to be an important contribution to mathematics[44] and it continues to be an active topic of research for both theoretical reasons and applications.[45][46][47] 
Introduction
A stochastic or random process can be defined as a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set.[4][5] The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time.[1] Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or  -dimensional Euclidean space.[1][5] An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time.[48][49] A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.[28][50] 
 A single computer-simulated sample function or realization, among other terms, of a three-dimensional Wiener or Brownian motion process for time 0 ≤ t ≤ 2. The index set of this stochastic process is the non-negative numbers, while its state space is three-dimensional Euclidean space. 
Classifications
A stochastic process can be classified in different ways, for example, by its state space, its index set, or the dependence among the random variables. One common way of classification is by the cardinality of the index set and the state space.[51][52][53] 
When interpreted as time, if the index set of a stochastic process has a finite or countable number of elements, such as a finite set of numbers, the set of integers, or the natural numbers, then the stochastic process is said to be in discrete time.[54][55] If the index set is some interval of the real line, then time is said to be continuous. The two types of stochastic processes are respectively referred to as discrete-time and continuous-time stochastic processes.[48][56][57] Discrete-time stochastic processes are considered easier to study because continuous-time processes require more advanced mathematical techniques and knowledge, particularly due to the index set being uncountable.[58][59] If the index set is the integers, or some subset of them, then the stochastic process can also be called a random sequence.[55] 
If the state space is the integers or natural numbers, then the stochastic process is called a discrete or integer-valued stochastic process. If the state space is the real line, then the stochastic process is referred to as a real-valued stochastic process or a process with continuous state space. If the state space is  -dimensional Euclidean space, then the stochastic process is called a  -dimensional vector process or  -vector process.[51][52] 
Etymology
The word stochastic in English was originally used as an adjective with the definition "pertaining to conjecturing", and stemming from a Greek word meaning "to aim at a mark, guess", and the Oxford English Dictionary gives the year 1662 as its earliest occurrence.[60] In his work on probability Ars Conjectandi, originally published in Latin in 1713, Jakob Bernoulli used the phrase "Ars Conjectandi sive Stochastice", which has been translated to "the art of conjecturing or stochastics".[61] This phrase was used, with reference to Bernoulli, by Ladislaus Bortkiewicz[62] who in 1917 wrote in German the word stochastik with a sense meaning random. The term stochastic process first appeared in English in a 1934 paper by Joseph Doob.[60] For the term and a specific mathematical definition, Doob cited another 1934 paper, where the term stochastischer Prozeß was used in German by Aleksandr Khinchin,[63][64] though the German term had been used earlier, for example, by Andrei Kolmogorov in 1931.[65] 
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, early occurrences of the word random in English with its current meaning, which relates to chance or luck, date back to the 16th century, while earlier recorded usages started in the 14th century as a noun meaning "impetuosity, great speed, force, or violence (in riding, running, striking, etc.)". The word itself comes from a Middle French word meaning "speed, haste", and it is probably derived from a French verb meaning "to run" or "to gallop". The first written appearance of the term random process pre-dates stochastic process, which the Oxford English Dictionary also gives as a synonym, and was used in an article by Francis Edgeworth published in 1888.[66] 
Terminology
The definition of a stochastic process varies,[67] but a stochastic process is traditionally defined as a collection of random variables indexed by some set.[68][69] The terms random process and stochastic process are considered synonyms and are used interchangeably, without the index set being precisely specified.[27][29][30][70][71][72] Both "collection",[28][70] or "family" are used[4][73] while instead of "index set", sometimes the terms "parameter set"[28] or "parameter space"[30] are used. 
The term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process,[5][74][75] though sometimes it is only used when the stochastic process takes real values.[28][73] This term is also used when the index sets are mathematical spaces other than the real line,[5][76] while the terms stochastic process and random process are usually used when the index set is interpreted as time,[5][76][77] and other terms are used such as random field when the index set is  -dimensional Euclidean space  or a manifold.[5][28][30] 
Notation
A stochastic process can be denoted, among other ways, by  ,[56]  ,[69]  [78]  or simply as  . Some authors mistakenly write  even though it is an abuse of function notation.[79] For example,  or  are used to refer to the random variable with the index  , and not the entire stochastic process.[78] If the index set is  , then one can write, for example,  to denote the stochastic process.[29] 
Examples
Bernoulli process
Main article: Bernoulli process
One of the simplest stochastic processes is the Bernoulli process,[80] which is a sequence of independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables, where each random variable takes either the value one or zero, say one with probability  and zero with probability  . This process can be linked to an idealisation of repeatedly flipping a coin, where the probability of obtaining a head is taken to be  and its value is one, while the value of a tail is zero.[81] In other words, a Bernoulli process is a sequence of iid Bernoulli random variables,[82] where each idealised coin flip is an example of a Bernoulli trial.[83] 
Random walk
Main article: Random walk
Random walks are stochastic processes that are usually defined as sums of iid random variables or random vectors in Euclidean space, so they are processes that change in discrete time.[84][85][86][87][88] But some also use the term to refer to processes that change in continuous time,[89] particularly the Wiener process used in financial models, which has led to some confusion, resulting in its criticism.[90] There are various other types of random walks, defined so their state spaces can be other mathematical objects, such as lattices and groups, and in general they are highly studied and have many applications in different disciplines.[89][91] 
A classic example of a random walk is known as the simple random walk, which is a stochastic process in discrete time with the integers as the state space, and is based on a Bernoulli process, where each Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple random walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say,  , or decreases by one with probability  , so the index set of this random walk is the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers. If  , this random walk is called a symmetric random walk.[92][93] 
Wiener process
Main article: Wiener process
The Wiener process is a stochastic process with stationary and independent increments that are normally distributed based on the size of the increments.[2][94] The Wiener process is named after Norbert Wiener, who proved its mathematical existence, but the process is also called the Brownian motion process or just Brownian motion due to its historical connection as a model for Brownian movement in liquids.[95][96][97] 
 Realizations of Wiener processes (or Brownian motion processes) with drift (blue) and without drift (red) 
Playing a central role in the theory of probability, the Wiener process is often considered the most important and studied stochastic process, with connections to other stochastic processes.[1][2][3][98][99][100][101] Its index set and state space are the non-negative numbers and real numbers, respectively, so it has both continuous index set and states space.[102] But the process can be defined more generally so its state space can be  -dimensional Euclidean space.[91][99][103] If the mean of any increment is zero, then the resulting Wiener or Brownian motion process is said to have zero drift. If the mean of the increment for any two points in time is equal to the time difference multiplied by some constant  , which is a real number, then the resulting stochastic process is said to have drift  .[104][105][106] 
Almost surely, a sample path of a Wiener process is continuous everywhere but nowhere differentiable. It can be considered as a continuous version of the simple random walk.[49][105] The process arises as the mathematical limit of other stochastic processes such as certain random walks rescaled,[107][108] which is the subject of Donsker's theorem or invariance principle, also known as the functional central limit theorem.[109][110][111] 
The Wiener process is a member of some important families of stochastic processes, including Markov processes, Lévy processes and Gaussian processes.[2][49] The process also has many applications and is the main stochastic process used in stochastic calculus.[112][113] It plays a central role in quantitative finance,[114][115] where it is used, for example, in the Black–Scholes–Merton model.[116] The process is also used in different fields, including the majority of natural sciences as well as some branches of social sciences, as a mathematical model for various random phenomena.[3][117][118] 
Poisson process
Main article: Poisson process
The Poisson process is a stochastic process that has different forms and definitions.[119][120] It can be defined as a counting process, which is a stochastic process that represents the random number of points or events up to some time. The number of points of the process that are located in the interval from zero to some given time is a Poisson random variable that depends on that time and some parameter. This process has the natural numbers as its state space and the non-negative numbers as its index set. This process is also called the Poisson counting process, since it can be interpreted as an example of a counting process.[119] 
If a Poisson process is defined with a single positive constant, then the process is called a homogeneous Poisson process.[119][121] The homogeneous Poisson process is a member of important classes of stochastic processes such as Markov processes and Lévy processes.[49] 
The homogeneous Poisson process can be defined and generalized in different ways. It can be defined such that its index set is the real line, and this stochastic process is also called the stationary Poisson process.[122][123] If the parameter constant of the Poisson process is replaced with some non-negative integrable function of  , the resulting process is called an inhomogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson process, where the average density of points of the process is no longer constant.[124] Serving as a fundamental process in queueing theory, the Poisson process is an important process for mathematical models, where it finds applications for models of events randomly occurring in certain time windows.[125][126] 
Defined on the real line, the Poisson process can be interpreted as a stochastic process,[49][127] among other random objects.[128][129] But then it can be defined on the  -dimensional Euclidean space or other mathematical spaces,[130] where it is often interpreted as a random set or a random counting measure, instead of a stochastic process.[128][129] In this setting, the Poisson process, also called the Poisson point process, is one of the most important objects in probability theory, both for applications and theoretical reasons.[22][131] But it has been remarked that the Poisson process does not receive as much attention as it should, partly due to it often being considered just on the real line, and not on other mathematical spaces.[131][132] 
Definitions
Stochastic process
A stochastic process is defined as a collection of random variables defined on a common probability space  , where  is a sample space,  is a  -algebra, and  is a probability measure; and the random variables, indexed by some set  , all take values in the same mathematical space  , which must be measurable with respect to some  -algebra  .[28] 
In other words, for a given probability space  and a measurable space  , a stochastic process is a collection of  -valued random variables, which can be written as:[80] 
 
Historically, in many problems from the natural sciences a point  had the meaning of time, so  is a random variable representing a value observed at time  .[133] A stochastic process can also be written as  to reflect that it is actually a function of two variables,  and  .[28][134] 
There are other ways to consider a stochastic process, with the above definition being considered the traditional one.[68][69] For example, a stochastic process can be interpreted or defined as a  -valued random variable, where  is the space of all the possible functions from the set  into the space  .[27][68] However this alternative definition as a "function-valued random variable" in general requires additional regularity assumptions to be well-defined.[135] 
Index set
The set  is called the index set[4][51] or parameter set[28][136] of the stochastic process. Often this set is some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers or an interval, giving the set  the interpretation of time.[1] In addition to these sets, the index set  can be another set with a total order or a more general set,[1][54] such as the Cartesian plane  or  -dimensional Euclidean space, where an element  can represent a point in space.[48][137] That said, many results and theorems are only possible for stochastic processes with a totally ordered index set.[138] 
State space
The mathematical space  of a stochastic process is called its state space. This mathematical space can be defined using integers, real lines,  -dimensional Euclidean spaces, complex planes, or more abstract mathematical spaces. The state space is defined using elements that reflect the different values that the stochastic process can take.[1][5][28][51][56] 
Sample function
A sample function is a single outcome of a stochastic process, so it is formed by taking a single possible value of each random variable of the stochastic process.[28][139] More precisely, if  is a stochastic process, then for any point  , the mapping 
 
is called a sample function, a realization, or, particularly when  is interpreted as time, a sample path of the stochastic process  .[50] This means that for a fixed  , there exists a sample function that maps the index set  to the state space  .[28] Other names for a sample function of a stochastic process include trajectory, path function[140] or path.[141] 
Increment
An increment of a stochastic process is the difference between two random variables of the same stochastic process. For a stochastic process with an index set that can be interpreted as time, an increment is how much the stochastic process changes over a certain time period. For example, if  is a stochastic process with state space  and index set  , then for any two non-negative numbers  and  such that  , the difference  is a  -valued random variable known as an increment.[48][49] When interested in the increments, often the state space  is the real line or the natural numbers, but it can be  -dimensional Euclidean space or more abstract spaces such as Banach spaces.[49] 
Further definitions
Law
For a stochastic process  defined on the probability space  , the law of stochastic process  is defined as the image measure: 
 
where  is a probability measure, the symbol  denotes function composition and  is the pre-image of the measurable function or, equivalently, the  -valued random variable  , where  is the space of all the possible  -valued functions of  , so the law of a stochastic process is a probability measure.[27][68][142][143] 
For a measurable subset  of  , the pre-image of  gives 
 
so the law of a  can be written as:[28] 
 
The law of a stochastic process or a random variable is also called the probability law, probability distribution, or the distribution.[133][142][144][145][146] 
Finite-dimensional probability distributions
Main article: Finite-dimensional distribution
For a stochastic process  with law  , its finite-dimensional distribution for  is defined as: 
 
This measure  is the joint distribution of the random vector  ; it can be viewed as a "projection" of the law  onto a finite subset of  .[27][147] 
For any measurable subset  of the  -fold Cartesian power  , the finite-dimensional distributions of a stochastic process  can be written as:[28] 
 
The finite-dimensional distributions of a stochastic process satisfy two mathematical conditions known as consistency conditions.[57] 
Stationarity
Main article: Stationary process
Stationarity is a mathematical property that a stochastic process has when all the random variables of that stochastic process are identically distributed. In other words, if  is a stationary stochastic process, then for any  the random variable  has the same distribution, which means that for any set of  index set values  , the corresponding  random variables 
 
all have the same probability distribution. The index set of a stationary stochastic process is usually interpreted as time, so it can be the integers or the real line.[148][149] But the concept of stationarity also exists for point processes and random fields, where the index set is not interpreted as time.[148][150][151] 
When the index set  can be interpreted as time, a stochastic process is said to be stationary if its finite-dimensional distributions are invariant under translations of time. This type of stochastic process can be used to describe a physical system that is in steady state, but still experiences random fluctuations.[148] The intuition behind stationarity is that as time passes the distribution of the stationary stochastic process remains the same.[152] A sequence of random variables forms a stationary stochastic process only if the random variables are identically distributed.[148] 
A stochastic process with the above definition of stationarity is sometimes said to be strictly stationary, but there are other forms of stationarity. One example is when a discrete-time or continuous-time stochastic process  is said to be stationary in the wide sense, then the process  has a finite second moment for all  and the covariance of the two random variables  and  depends only on the number  for all  .[152][153] Khinchin introduced the related concept of stationarity in the wide sense, which has other names including covariance stationarity or stationarity in the broad sense.[153][154] 
Filtration
A filtration is an increasing sequence of sigma-algebras defined in relation to some probability space and an index set that has some total order relation, such as in the case of the index set being some subset of the real numbers. More formally, if a stochastic process has an index set with a total order, then a filtration  , on a probability space  is a family of sigma-algebras such that  for all  , where  and  denotes the total order of the index set  .[51] With the concept of a filtration, it is possible to study the amount of information contained in a stochastic process  at  , which can be interpreted as time  .[51][155] The intuition behind a filtration  is that as time  passes, more and more information on  is known or available, which is captured in  , resulting in finer and finer partitions of  .[156][157] 
Modification
A modification of a stochastic process is another stochastic process, which is closely related to the original stochastic process. More precisely, a stochastic process  that has the same index set  , state space  , and probability space  as another stochastic process  is said to be a modification of  if for all  the following 
 
holds. Two stochastic processes that are modifications of each other have the same finite-dimensional law[158] and they are said to be stochastically equivalent or equivalent.[159] 
Instead of modification, the term version is also used,[150][160][161][162] however some authors use the term version when two stochastic processes have the same finite-dimensional distributions, but they may be defined on different probability spaces, so two processes that are modifications of each other, are also versions of each other, in the latter sense, but not the converse.[163][142] 
If a continuous-time real-valued stochastic process meets certain moment conditions on its increments, then the Kolmogorov continuity theorem says that there exists a modification of this process that has continuous sample paths with probability one, so the stochastic process has a continuous modification or version.[161][162][164] The theorem can also be generalized to random fields so the index set is  -dimensional Euclidean space[165] as well as to stochastic processes with metric spaces as their state spaces.[166] 
Indistinguishable
Two stochastic processes  and  defined on the same probability space  with the same index set  and set space  are said be indistinguishable if the following 
 
holds.[142][158] If two  and  are modifications of each other and are almost surely continuous, then  and  are indistinguishable.[167] 
Separability
Separability is a property of a stochastic process based on its index set in relation to the probability measure. The property is assumed so that functionals of stochastic processes or random fields with uncountable index sets can form random variables. For a stochastic process to be separable, in addition to other conditions, its index set must be a separable space,[b] which means that the index set has a dense countable subset.[150][168] 
More precisely, a real-valued continuous-time stochastic process  with a probability space  is separable if its index set  has a dense countable subset  and there is a set  of probability zero, so  , such that for every open set  and every closed set  , the two events  and  differ from each other at most on a subset of  .[169][170][171] The definition of separability[c] can also be stated for other index sets and state spaces,[174] such as in the case of random fields, where the index set as well as the state space can be  -dimensional Euclidean space.[30][150] 
The concept of separability of a stochastic process was introduced by Joseph Doob,.[168] The underlying idea of separability is to make a countable set of points of the index set determine the properties of the stochastic process.[172] Any stochastic process with a countable index set already meets the separability conditions, so discrete-time stochastic processes are always separable.[175] A theorem by Doob, sometimes known as Doob's separability theorem, says that any real-valued continuous-time stochastic process has a separable modification.[168][170][176] Versions of this theorem also exist for more general stochastic processes with index sets and state spaces other than the real line.[136] 
Independence
Two stochastic processes  and  defined on the same probability space  with the same index set  are said be independent if for all  and for every choice of epochs  , the random vectors  and  are independent.[177]: p. 515  
Uncorrelatedness
Two stochastic processes  and  are called uncorrelated if their cross-covariance  is zero for all times.[178]: p. 142  Formally: 
 .
Independence implies uncorrelatedness
If two stochastic processes  and  are independent, then they are also uncorrelated.[178]: p. 151  
Orthogonality
Two stochastic processes  and  are called orthogonal if their cross-correlation  is zero for all times.[178]: p. 142  Formally: 
 .
Skorokhod space
Main article: Skorokhod space
A Skorokhod space, also written as Skorohod space, is a mathematical space of all the functions that are right-continuous with left limits, defined on some interval of the real line such as  or  , and take values on the real line or on some metric space.[179][180][181] Such functions are known as càdlàg or cadlag functions, based on the acronym of the French phrase continue à droite, limite à gauche.[179][182] A Skorokhod function space, introduced by Anatoliy Skorokhod,[181] is often denoted with the letter  ,[179][180][181][182] so the function space is also referred to as space  .[179][183][184] The notation of this function space can also include the interval on which all the càdlàg functions are defined, so, for example,  denotes the space of càdlàg functions defined on the unit interval  .[182][184][185] 
Skorokhod function spaces are frequently used in the theory of stochastic processes because it often assumed that the sample functions of continuous-time stochastic processes belong to a Skorokhod space.[181][183] Such spaces contain continuous functions, which correspond to sample functions of the Wiener process. But the space also has functions with discontinuities, which means that the sample functions of stochastic processes with jumps, such as the Poisson process (on the real line), are also members of this space.[184][186] 
Regularity
In the context of mathematical construction of stochastic processes, the term regularity is used when discussing and assuming certain conditions for a stochastic process to resolve possible construction issues.[187][188] For example, to study stochastic processes with uncountable index sets, it is assumed that the stochastic process adheres to some type of regularity condition such as the sample functions being continuous.[189][190] 
Further examples
Markov processes and chains
Main article: Markov chain
Markov processes are stochastic processes, traditionally in discrete or continuous time, that have the Markov property, which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic process. In other words, the behavior of the process in the future is stochastically independent of its behavior in the past, given the current state of the process.[191][192] 
The Brownian motion process and the Poisson process (in one dimension) are both examples of Markov processes[193] in continuous time, while random walks on the integers and the gambler's ruin problem are examples of Markov processes in discrete time.[194][195] 
A Markov chain is a type of Markov process that has either discrete state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies.[196] For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time),[197][198][199][200] but it has been also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).[196] It has been argued that the first definition of a Markov chain, where it has discrete time, now tends to be used, despite the second definition having been used by researchers like Joseph Doob and Kai Lai Chung.[201] 
Markov processes form an important class of stochastic processes and have applications in many areas.[39][202] For example, they are the basis for a general stochastic simulation method known as Markov chain Monte Carlo, which is used for simulating random objects with specific probability distributions, and has found application in Bayesian statistics.[203][204] 
The concept of the Markov property was originally for stochastic processes in continuous and discrete time, but the property has been adapted for other index sets such as  -dimensional Euclidean space, which results in collections of random variables known as Markov random fields.[205][206][207] 
Martingale
Main article: Martingale (probability theory)
A martingale is a discrete-time or continuous-time stochastic process with the property that, at every instant, given the current value and all the past values of the process, the conditional expectation of every future value is equal to the current value. In discrete time, if this property holds for the next value, then it holds for all future values. The exact mathematical definition of a martingale requires two other conditions coupled with the mathematical concept of a filtration, which is related to the intuition of increasing available information as time passes. Martingales are usually defined to be real-valued,[208][209][155] but they can also be complex-valued[210] or even more general.[211] 
A symmetric random walk and a Wiener process (with zero drift) are both examples of martingales, respectively, in discrete and continuous time.[208][209] For a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables  with zero mean, the stochastic process formed from the successive partial sums  is a discrete-time martingale.[212] In this aspect, discrete-time martingales generalize the idea of partial sums of independent random variables.[213] 
Martingales can also be created from stochastic processes by applying some suitable transformations, which is the case for the homogeneous Poisson process (on the real line) resulting in a martingale called the compensated Poisson process.[209] Martingales can also be built from other martingales.[212] For example, there are martingales based on the martingale the Wiener process, forming continuous-time martingales.[208][214] 
Martingales mathematically formalize the idea of a 'fair game' where it is possible form reasonable expectations for payoffs,[215] and they were originally developed to show that it is not possible to gain an 'unfair' advantage in such a game.[216] But now they are used in many areas of probability, which is one of the main reasons for studying them.[155][216][217] Many problems in probability have been solved by finding a martingale in the problem and studying it.[218] Martingales will converge, given some conditions on their moments, so they are often used to derive convergence results, due largely to martingale convergence theorems.[213][219][220] 
Martingales have many applications in statistics, but it has been remarked that its use and application are not as widespread as it could be in the field of statistics, particularly statistical inference.[221] They have found applications in areas in probability theory such as queueing theory and Palm calculus[222] and other fields such as economics[223] and finance.[17] 
Lévy process
Main article: Lévy process
Lévy processes are types of stochastic processes that can be considered as generalizations of random walks in continuous time.[49][224] These processes have many applications in fields such as finance, fluid mechanics, physics and biology.[225][226] The main defining characteristics of these processes are their stationarity and independence properties, so they were known as processes with stationary and independent increments. In other words, a stochastic process  is a Lévy process if for  non-negatives numbers,  , the corresponding  increments 
 
are all independent of each other, and the distribution of each increment only depends on the difference in time.[49] 
A Lévy process can be defined such that its state space is some abstract mathematical space, such as a Banach space, but the processes are often defined so that they take values in Euclidean space. The index set is the non-negative numbers, so  , which gives the interpretation of time. Important stochastic processes such as the Wiener process, the homogeneous Poisson process (in one dimension), and subordinators are all Lévy processes.[49][224] 
Random field
Main article: Random field
A random field is a collection of random variables indexed by a  -dimensional Euclidean space or some manifold. In general, a random field can be considered an example of a stochastic or random process, where the index set is not necessarily a subset of the real line.[30] But there is a convention that an indexed collection of random variables is called a random field when the index has two or more dimensions.[5][28][227] If the specific definition of a stochastic process requires the index set to be a subset of the real line, then the random field can be considered as a generalization of stochastic process.[228] 
Point process
Main article: Point process
A point process is a collection of points randomly located on some mathematical space such as the real line,  -dimensional Euclidean space, or more abstract spaces. Sometimes the term point process is not preferred, as historically the word process denoted an evolution of some system in time, so a point process is also called a random point field.[229] There are different interpretations of a point process, such a random counting measure or a random set.[230][231] Some authors regard a point process and stochastic process as two different objects such that a point process is a random object that arises from or is associated with a stochastic process,[232][233] though it has been remarked that the difference between point processes and stochastic processes is not clear.[233] 
Other authors consider a point process as a stochastic process, where the process is indexed by sets of the underlying space[d] on which it is defined, such as the real line or  -dimensional Euclidean space.[236][237] Other stochastic processes such as renewal and counting processes are studied in the theory of point processes.[238][233] 
History
Early probability theory
Probability theory has its origins in games of chance, which have a long history, with some games being played thousands of years ago,[239] but very little analysis on them was done in terms of probability.[240] The year 1654 is often considered the birth of probability theory when French mathematicians Pierre Fermat and Blaise Pascal had a written correspondence on probability, motivated by a gambling problem.[241][242] But there was earlier mathematical work done on the probability of gambling games such as Liber de Ludo Aleae by Gerolamo Cardano, written in the 16th century but posthumously published later in 1663.[243] 
After Cardano, Jakob Bernoulli[e] wrote Ars Conjectandi, which is considered a significant event in the history of probability theory. Bernoulli's book was published, also posthumously, in 1713 and inspired many mathematicians to study probability.[245][246] But despite some renowned mathematicians contributing to probability theory, such as Pierre-Simon Laplace, Abraham de Moivre, Carl Gauss, Siméon Poisson and Pafnuty Chebyshev,[247][248] most of the mathematical community[f] did not consider probability theory to be part of mathematics until the 20th century.[247][249][250][251] 
Statistical mechanics
In the physical sciences, scientists developed in the 19th century the discipline of statistical mechanics, where physical systems, such as containers filled with gases, are regarded or treated mathematically as collections of many moving particles. Although there were attempts to incorporate randomness into statistical physics by some scientists, such as Rudolf Clausius, most of the work had little or no randomness.[252][253] This changed in 1859 when James Clerk Maxwell contributed significantly to the field, more specifically, to the kinetic theory of gases, by presenting work where he modelled the gas particles as moving in random directions at random velocities.[254][255] The kinetic theory of gases and statistical physics continued to be developed in the second half of the 19th century, with work done chiefly by Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann and Josiah Gibbs, which would later have an influence on Albert Einstein's mathematical model for Brownian movement.[256] 
Measure theory and probability theory
At the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900, David Hilbert presented a list of mathematical problems, where his sixth problem asked for a mathematical treatment of physics and probability involving axioms.[248] Around the start of the 20th century, mathematicians developed measure theory, a branch of mathematics for studying integrals of mathematical functions, where two of the founders were French mathematicians, Henri Lebesgue and Émile Borel. In 1925, another French mathematician Paul Lévy published the first probability book that used ideas from measure theory.[248] 
In the 1920s, fundamental contributions to probability theory were made in the Soviet Union by mathematicians such as Sergei Bernstein, Aleksandr Khinchin,[g] and Andrei Kolmogorov.[251] Kolmogorov published in 1929 his first attempt at presenting a mathematical foundation, based on measure theory, for probability theory.[257] In the early 1930s, Khinchin and Kolmogorov set up probability seminars, which were attended by researchers such as Eugene Slutsky and Nikolai Smirnov,[258] and Khinchin gave the first mathematical definition of a stochastic process as a set of random variables indexed by the real line.[63][259][h] 
Birth of modern probability theory
In 1933, Andrei Kolmogorov published in German, his book on the foundations of probability theory titled Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung,[i] where Kolmogorov used measure theory to develop an axiomatic framework for probability theory. The publication of this book is now widely considered to be the birth of modern probability theory, when the theories of probability and stochastic processes became parts of mathematics.[248][251] 
After the publication of Kolmogorov's book, further fundamental work on probability theory and stochastic processes was done by Khinchin and Kolmogorov as well as other mathematicians such as Joseph Doob, William Feller, Maurice Fréchet, Paul Lévy, Wolfgang Doeblin, and Harald Cramér.[248][251] Decades later, Cramér referred to the 1930s as the "heroic period of mathematical probability theory".[251] World War II greatly interrupted the development of probability theory, causing, for example, the migration of Feller from Sweden to the United States of America[251] and the death of Doeblin, considered now a pioneer in stochastic processes.[261] 
 Mathematician Joseph Doob did early work on the theory of stochastic processes, making fundamental contributions, particularly in the theory of martingales.[262][260] His book Stochastic Processes is considered highly influential in the field of probability theory.[263] 
Stochastic processes after World War II
After World War II, the study of probability theory and stochastic processes gained more attention from mathematicians, with significant contributions made in many areas of probability and mathematics as well as the creation of new areas.[251][264] Starting in the 1940s, Kiyosi Itô published papers developing the field of stochastic calculus, which involves stochastic integrals and stochastic differential equations based on the Wiener or Brownian motion process.[265] 
Also starting in the 1940s, connections were made between stochastic processes, particularly martingales, and the mathematical field of potential theory, with early ideas by Shizuo Kakutani and then later work by Joseph Doob.[264] Further work, considered pioneering, was done by Gilbert Hunt in the 1950s, connecting Markov processes and potential theory, which had a significant effect on the theory of Lévy processes and led to more interest in studying Markov processes with methods developed by Itô.[21][266][267] 
In 1953, Doob published his book Stochastic processes, which had a strong influence on the theory of stochastic processes and stressed the importance of measure theory in probability.[264] [263] Doob also chiefly developed the theory of martingales, with later substantial contributions by Paul-André Meyer. Earlier work had been carried out by Sergei Bernstein, Paul Lévy and Jean Ville, the latter adopting the term martingale for the stochastic process.[268][269] Methods from the theory of martingales became popular for solving various probability problems. Techniques and theory were developed to study Markov processes and then applied to martingales. Conversely, methods from the theory of martingales were established to treat Markov processes.[264] 
Other fields of probability were developed and used to study stochastic processes, with one main approach being the theory of large deviations.[264] The theory has many applications in statistical physics, among other fields, and has core ideas going back to at least the 1930s. Later in the 1960s and 1970s, fundamental work was done by Alexander Wentzell in the Soviet Union and Monroe D. Donsker and Srinivasa Varadhan in the United States of America,[270] which would later result in Varadhan winning the 2007 Abel Prize.[271] In the 1990s and 2000s the theories of Schramm–Loewner evolution[272] and rough paths[142] were introduced and developed to study stochastic processes and other mathematical objects in probability theory, which respectively resulted in Fields Medals being awarded to Wendelin Werner[273] in 2008 and to Martin Hairer in 2014.[274] 
The theory of stochastic processes still continues to be a focus of research, with yearly international conferences on the topic of stochastic processes.[45][225] 
Discoveries of specific stochastic processes
Although Khinchin gave mathematical definitions of stochastic processes in the 1930s,[63][259] specific stochastic processes had already been discovered in different settings, such as the Brownian motion process and the Poisson process.[21][24] Some families of stochastic processes such as point processes or renewal processes have long and complex histories, stretching back centuries.[275] 
Bernoulli process
The Bernoulli process, which can serve as a mathematical model for flipping a biased coin, is possibly the first stochastic process to have been studied.[81] The process is a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials,[82] which are named after Jacob Bernoulli who used them to study games of chance, including probability problems proposed and studied earlier by Christiaan Huygens.[276] Bernoulli's work, including the Bernoulli process, were published in his book Ars Conjectandi in 1713.[277] 
Random walks
In 1905, Karl Pearson coined the term random walk while posing a problem describing a random walk on the plane, which was motivated by an application in biology, but such problems involving random walks had already been studied in other fields. Certain gambling problems that were studied centuries earlier can be considered as problems involving random walks.[89][277] For example, the problem known as the Gambler's ruin is based on a simple random walk,[195][278] and is an example of a random walk with absorbing barriers.[241][279] Pascal, Fermat and Huyens all gave numerical solutions to this problem without detailing their methods,[280] and then more detailed solutions were presented by Jakob Bernoulli and Abraham de Moivre.[281] 
For random walks in  -dimensional integer lattices, George Pólya published, in 1919 and 1921, work where he studied the probability of a symmetric random walk returning to a previous position in the lattice. Pólya showed that a symmetric random walk, which has an equal probability to advance in any direction in the lattice, will return to a previous position in the lattice an infinite number of times with probability one in one and two dimensions, but with probability zero in three or higher dimensions.[282][283] 
Wiener process
The Wiener process or Brownian motion process has its origins in different fields including statistics, finance and physics.[21] In 1880, Danish astronomer Thorvald Thiele wrote a paper on the method of least squares, where he used the process to study the errors of a model in time-series analysis.[284][285][286] The work is now considered as an early discovery of the statistical method known as Kalman filtering, but the work was largely overlooked. It is thought that the ideas in Thiele's paper were too advanced to have been understood by the broader mathematical and statistical community at the time.[286] 
 Norbert Wiener gave the first mathematical proof of the existence of the Wiener process. This mathematical object had appeared previously in the work of Thorvald Thiele, Louis Bachelier, and Albert Einstein.[21] 
The French mathematician Louis Bachelier used a Wiener process in his 1900 thesis[287][288] in order to model price changes on the Paris Bourse, a stock exchange,[289] without knowing the work of Thiele.[21] It has been speculated that Bachelier drew ideas from the random walk model of Jules Regnault, but Bachelier did not cite him,[290] and Bachelier's thesis is now considered pioneering in the field of financial mathematics.[289][290] 
It is commonly thought that Bachelier's work gained little attention and was forgotten for decades until it was rediscovered in the 1950s by the Leonard Savage, and then become more popular after Bachelier's thesis was translated into English in 1964. But the work was never forgotten in the mathematical community, as Bachelier published a book in 1912 detailing his ideas,[290] which was cited by mathematicians including Doob, Feller[290] and Kolmogorov.[21] The book continued to be cited, but then starting in the 1960s, the original thesis by Bachelier began to be cited more than his book when economists started citing Bachelier's work.[290] 
In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper where he studied the physical observation of Brownian motion or movement to explain the seemingly random movements of particles in liquids by using ideas from the kinetic theory of gases. Einstein derived a differential equation, known as a diffusion equation, for describing the probability of finding a particle in a certain region of space. Shortly after Einstein's first paper on Brownian movement, Marian Smoluchowski published work where he cited Einstein, but wrote that he had independently derived the equivalent results by using a different method.[291] 
Einstein's work, as well as experimental results obtained by Jean Perrin, later inspired Norbert Wiener in the 1920s[292] to use a type of measure theory, developed by Percy Daniell, and Fourier analysis to prove the existence of the Wiener process as a mathematical object.[21] 
Poisson process
The Poisson process is named after Siméon Poisson, due to its definition involving the Poisson distribution, but Poisson never studied the process.[22][293] There are a number of claims for early uses or discoveries of the Poisson process.[22][24] At the beginning of the 20th century, the Poisson process would arise independently in different situations.[22][24] In Sweden 1903, Filip Lundberg published a thesis containing work, now considered fundamental and pioneering, where he proposed to model insurance claims with a homogeneous Poisson process.[294][295] 
Another discovery occurred in Denmark in 1909 when A.K. Erlang derived the Poisson distribution when developing a mathematical model for the number of incoming phone calls in a finite time interval. Erlang was not at the time aware of Poisson's earlier work and assumed that the number phone calls arriving in each interval of time were independent to each other. He then found the limiting case, which is effectively recasting the Poisson distribution as a limit of the binomial distribution.[22] 
In 1910, Ernest Rutherford and Hans Geiger published experimental results on counting alpha particles. Motivated by their work, Harry Bateman studied the counting problem and derived Poisson probabilities as a solution to a family of differential equations, resulting in the independent discovery of the Poisson process.[22] After this time there were many studies and applications of the Poisson process, but its early history is complicated, which has been explained by the various applications of the process in numerous fields by biologists, ecologists, engineers and various physical scientists.[22] 
Markov processes
Markov processes and Markov chains are named after Andrey Markov who studied Markov chains in the early 20th century. Markov was interested in studying an extension of independent random sequences. In his first paper on Markov chains, published in 1906, Markov showed that under certain conditions the average outcomes of the Markov chain would converge to a fixed vector of values, so proving a weak law of large numbers without the independence assumption,[296][297][298] which had been commonly regarded as a requirement for such mathematical laws to hold.[298] Markov later used Markov chains to study the distribution of vowels in Eugene Onegin, written by Alexander Pushkin, and proved a central limit theorem for such chains. 
In 1912, Poincaré studied Markov chains on finite groups with an aim to study card shuffling. Other early uses of Markov chains include a diffusion model, introduced by Paul and Tatyana Ehrenfest in 1907, and a branching process, introduced by Francis Galton and Henry William Watson in 1873, preceding the work of Markov.[296][297] After the work of Galton and Watson, it was later revealed that their branching process had been independently discovered and studied around three decades earlier by Irénée-Jules Bienaymé.[299] Starting in 1928, Maurice Fréchet became interested in Markov chains, eventually resulting in him publishing in 1938 a detailed study on Markov chains.[296][300] 
Andrei Kolmogorov developed in a 1931 paper a large part of the early theory of continuous-time Markov processes.[251][257] Kolmogorov was partly inspired by Louis Bachelier's 1900 work on fluctuations in the stock market as well as Norbert Wiener's work on Einstein's model of Brownian movement.[257][301] He introduced and studied a particular set of Markov processes known as diffusion processes, where he derived a set of differential equations describing the processes.[257][302] Independent of Kolmogorov's work, Sydney Chapman derived in a 1928 paper an equation, now called the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation, in a less mathematically rigorous way than Kolmogorov, while studying Brownian movement.[303] The differential equations are now called the Kolmogorov equations[304] or the Kolmogorov–Chapman equations.[305] Other mathematicians who contributed significantly to the foundations of Markov processes include William Feller, starting in the 1930s, and then later Eugene Dynkin, starting in the 1950s.[251] 
Lévy processes
Lévy processes such as the Wiener process and the Poisson process (on the real line) are named after Paul Lévy who started studying them in the 1930s,[225] but they have connections to infinitely divisible distributions going back to the 1920s.[224] In a 1932 paper, Kolmogorov derived a characteristic function for random variables associated with Lévy processes. This result was later derived under more general conditions by Lévy in 1934, and then Khinchin independently gave an alternative form for this characteristic function in 1937.[251][306] In addition to Lévy, Khinchin and Kolomogrov, early fundamental contributions to the theory of Lévy processes were made by Bruno de Finetti and Kiyosi Itô.[224] 
Mathematical construction
In mathematics, constructions of mathematical objects are needed, which is also the case for stochastic processes, to prove that they exist mathematically.[57] There are two main approaches for constructing a stochastic process. One approach involves considering a measurable space of functions, defining a suitable measurable mapping from a probability space to this measurable space of functions, and then deriving the corresponding finite-dimensional distributions.[307] 
Another approach involves defining a collection of random variables to have specific finite-dimensional distributions, and then using Kolmogorov's existence theorem[j] to prove a corresponding stochastic process exists.[57][307] This theorem, which is an existence theorem for measures on infinite product spaces,[311] says that if any finite-dimensional distributions satisfy two conditions, known as consistency conditions, then there exists a stochastic process with those finite-dimensional distributions.[57] 
Construction issues
When constructing continuous-time stochastic processes certain mathematical difficulties arise, due to the uncountable index sets, which do not occur with discrete-time processes.[58][59] One problem is that it is possible to have more than one stochastic process with the same finite-dimensional distributions. For example, both the left-continuous modification and the right-continuous modification of a Poisson process have the same finite-dimensional distributions.[312] This means that the distribution of the stochastic process does not, necessarily, specify uniquely the properties of the sample functions of the stochastic process.[307][313] 
Another problem is that functionals of continuous-time process that rely upon an uncountable number of points of the index set may not be measurable, so the probabilities of certain events may not be well-defined.[168] For example, the supremum of a stochastic process or random field is not necessarily a well-defined random variable.[30][59] For a continuous-time stochastic process  , other characteristics that depend on an uncountable number of points of the index set  include:[168] 
	a sample function of a stochastic process  is a continuous function of  ;
	a sample function of a stochastic process  is a bounded function of  ; and
	a sample function of a stochastic process  is an increasing function of  .
where the symbol ∈ can be read "a member of the set", as in  a member of the set  . 
To overcome the two difficulties described above, i.e., "more than one..." and "functionals of...", different assumptions and approaches are possible.[69] 
Resolving construction issues
One approach for avoiding mathematical construction issues of stochastic processes, proposed by Joseph Doob, is to assume that the stochastic process is separable.[314] Separability ensures that infinite-dimensional distributions determine the properties of sample functions by requiring that sample functions are essentially determined by their values on a dense countable set of points in the index set.[315] Furthermore, if a stochastic process is separable, then functionals of an uncountable number of points of the index set are measurable and their probabilities can be studied.[168][315] 
Another approach is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov,[316] for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For the construction of such a stochastic process, it is assumed that the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This approach is now more used than the separability assumption,[69][262] but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.[317] 
Although less used, the separability assumption is considered more general because every stochastic process has a separable version.[262] It is also used when it is not possible to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space.[173] For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as  -dimensional Euclidean space.[30][318] 
Application
Applications in Finance
Black-Scholes Model
One of the most famous applications of stochastic processes in finance is the Black-Scholes model for option pricing. Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Solow, this model uses Geometric Brownian motion, a specific type of stochastic process, to describe the dynamics of asset prices.[319][320] The model assumes that the price of a stock follows a continuous-time stochastic process and provides a closed-form solution for pricing European-style options. The Black-Scholes formula has had a profound impact on financial markets, forming the basis for much of modern options trading. 
The key assumption of the Black-Scholes model is that the price of a financial asset, such as a stock, follows a log-normal distribution, with its continuous returns following a normal distribution. Although the model has limitations, such as the assumption of constant volatility, it remains widely used due to its simplicity and practical relevance. 
Stochastic Volatility Models
Another significant application of stochastic processes in finance is in stochastic volatility models, which aim to capture the time-varying nature of market volatility. The Heston model[321] is a popular example, allowing for the volatility of asset prices to follow its own stochastic process. Unlike the Black-Scholes model, which assumes constant volatility, stochastic volatility models provide a more flexible framework for modeling market dynamics, particularly during periods of high uncertainty or market stress. 
Applications in Biology
Population Dynamics
One of the primary applications of stochastic processes in biology is in population dynamics. In contrast to deterministic models, which assume that populations change in predictable ways, stochastic models account for the inherent randomness in births, deaths, and migration. The birth-death process,[322] a simple stochastic model, describes how populations fluctuate over time due to random births and deaths. These models are particularly important when dealing with small populations, where random events can have large impacts, such as in the case of endangered species or small microbial populations. 
Another example is the branching process,[323] which models the growth of a population where each individual reproduces independently. The branching process is often used to describe population extinction or explosion, particularly in epidemiology, where it can model the spread of infectious diseases within a population.

Notes
	
•  The term Brownian motion can refer to the physical process, also known as Brownian movement, and the stochastic process, a mathematical object, but to avoid ambiguity this article uses the terms Brownian motion process or Wiener process for the latter in a style similar to, for example, Gikhman and Skorokhod[19] or Rosenblatt.[20] 
•  •  The term "separable" appears twice here with two different meanings, where the first meaning is from probability and the second from topology and analysis. For a stochastic process to be separable (in a probabilistic sense), its index set must be a separable space (in a topological or analytic sense), in addition to other conditions.[136] 
•  •  The definition of separability for a continuous-time real-valued stochastic process can be stated in other ways.[172][173] 
•  •  In the context of point processes, the term "state space" can mean the space on which the point process is defined such as the real line,[234][235] which corresponds to the index set in stochastic process terminology. 
•  •  Also known as James or Jacques Bernoulli.[244] 
•  •  It has been remarked that a notable exception was the St Petersburg School in Russia, where mathematicians led by Chebyshev studied probability theory.[249]

Abstract 
Combined ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging has attracted significant interests for intravascular imaging such as atheromatous plaque detection, with ultrasound imaging providing spatial location and morphology and photoacoustic imaging highlighting molecular composition of the plaque. Conventional ultrasound imaging systems utilize piezoelectric ultrasound transducers, which suffer from limited frequency bandwidths and reduced sensitivity with miniature transducer elements. Recent advances on optical methods for both ultrasound generation and detection have shown great promise, as they provide efficient and ultrabroadband ultrasound generation and sensitive and ultrabroadband ultrasound detection. As such, all-optical ultrasound imaging has a great potential to become a next generation ultrasound imaging method. In this paper, we review recent developments on optical ultrasound transmitters, detectors, and all-optical ultrasound imaging systems, with a particular focus on fiber-based probes for intravascular imaging. We further discuss our thoughts on future directions on developing combined all-optical photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging systems for intravascular imaging.

a consequent risk of injury to the operator. Such types may be
required to be replaced with modern equivalents. ACBs are
normally fitted with integral overcurrent protection, thus avoiding
the need for separate protection devices. However, the operating
time characteristics of the integral protection are often designed
to make discrimination with MCBs/MCCBs/fuses easier and so
they may not be in accordance with the standard dependent
time characteristics given in IEC 60255-3. Therefore, problems
in co-ordination with discrete protection relays may still arise,
but modern numerical relays have more flexible characteristics
to alleviate such difficulties. ACBs will also have facilities for
accepting an external trip signal, and this can be used in
conjunction with an external relay if desired. Figure B3.6
illustrates the typical tripping characteristics available.
5.4 Oil Circuit Breakers (OCBs)
Oil circuit breakers have been very popular for many years for
industrial supply systems at voltages of 3.3kV and above. They
are found in both ‘bulk oil’ and ‘minimum oil’ types, the only
significant difference being the volume of oil in the tank.
In this type of breaker, the main contacts are housed in an
oil-filled tank, with the oil acting as the both the insulation and
the arc-quenching medium. The arc produced during contact
separation under fault conditions causes dissociation of the
hydrocarbon insulating oil into hydrogen and carbon. The
hydrogen extinguishes the arc. The carbon produced mixes
with the oil. As the carbon is conductive, the oil must be changed
after a prescribed number of fault clearances, when the degree
of contamination reaches an unacceptable level.
Because of the fire risk involved with oil, precautions such as
the construction of fire/blast walls may have to be taken when
OCBs are installed.
5.5 Vacuum Circuit Breakers (VCBs)
Since the introduction of vacuum switching technology in the
1960’s, Vacuum switchgear has all but replaced Air Circuit Breaker
(ACBs) and Oil Circuit Breaker (OCBs) at medium voltage levels.
Vacuum switchgear is rated for fault level up to 63kA with
continuous ratings of greater than 5000A.
The vacuum interrupter is a compact, inherently reliable and
maintenance free device with an expected life of more than
10,000 operations and is capable of interrupting full fault
currents up to 100 times.
These characteristics have resulted in a dramatic reduction in
switchgear maintenance compared to ACBs or OCBs and are
used in a wide range of applications, including Distribution
networks and medium to large industry.
The reduction in maintenance requirements and smaller dimensions
have allowed the configuration of switchgear to be adapted from
the conventional withdrawable pattern to a fixed pattern Air Insulated
Switchgear (AIS, See Fig B3.7). Fixed pattern switchgear is generally
more compact, easier to install and has simpler operation.

6. Protection relays
5. Industrial circuit breakers
When the circuit breaker itself does not have integral protection,
then a suitable external relay will have to be provided. For an
industrial system, the most common protection relays are
time- delayed overcurrent and earth fault relays. Chapter [C1:
Overcurrent Protection for Phase and Earth Faults] provides
details of the application of overcurrent relays.
Traditionally, for three wire systems, overcurrent relays have
often been applied to two phases only for relay element
economy. Even with modern multi-element relay designs,
economy is still a consideration in terms of the number of
analogue current inputs that have to be provided. Two
overcurrent elements will detect any interphase fault, so it is
conventional to apply two elements on the same phases at
all relay locations. The phase CT residual current connections
for an earth fault relay element are unaffected by this
convention. Figure B3.9 illustrates the possible relay
connections and limitations on settings.
The fixed pattern is also available in a gas insulated configuration
(GIS) where the Vacuum Interrupter and main current carrying
parts are insulated with SF6 gas. This further enhances the
compact nature of the design. Typically 36kV GIS has similar
dimensions to 12kV AIS (See Figure B3.8).
Gas Insulated Switchgear is normally found in higher voltage
applications. i.e. 24kV and above.
A variation of vacuum switchgear is the vacuum contactor. This
device has a limited fault interrupting rating and is used in
conjunction with High Rupturing Capacity (HRC) fuses, The
contactor has a very high operating duty – up to 1 million
operations, and is typically used to switch MV motors.
5.6 SF6 circuit breakers
Circuit breakers using SF6 gas as the arc-quenching medium
are also available and in some countries and for some
applications are preferred. Generally these have similar ratings
to those of vacuum switchgear and in some cases can be
incorporated into the same cubicle as vacuum circuit breakers.
5.7 Improved safety
Changes in International Standards have resulted in
improvements to operator safety. One area is Internal Arc (Arc
Flash) protection. Many switchgear designs have passive
protection ‘built in’ and are capable of controlling the effects
of an internal arc fault even at the highest fault levels available.
To supplement this, or to improve the performance of existing
switchgear, active solutions, which detect the occurrence of
an arc fault and then initiate the disconnection of the supply,
are available in conjunction with protection relay systems. For
more details on arc protection solutions please refer to Chapter
[C11: Arc Protection].

Industrial & Commercial Power System Protection
Loads such as induction motors draw significant reactive
power from the supply system, and a poor overall power factor
may result. The flow of reactive power increases the voltage-
drops through series reactances such as transformers and
reactors, it uses up some of the current carrying capacity of
power system plant and it increases the resistive losses in
the power system.
To offset the losses and restrictions in plant capacity they
incur and to assist with voltage regulation, Utilities usually
apply tariff penalties to large industrial or commercial
customers for running their plant at excessively low power
factor. The customer is thereby induced to improve the power
factor of his system and it may be cost-effective to install
fixed or variable power factor correction equipment to raise
or regulate the plant power factor to an acceptable level.
Shunt capacitors are often used to improve power factor. The
basis for compensation is illustrated in Figure B3.14, where
∠φ1 represents the uncorrected power factor angle and ∠φ2
the angle relating to the desired power factor, after correction.
The following may be deduced from this vector diagram:
a. Uncorrected power factor = kW

Power factor correction principle
Voltage relays have been widely used in industrial power
supply systems. The principle purposes are to detect
undervoltage and/or overvoltage conditions at switchboards
to disconnect supplies before damage can be caused from
these conditions or to provide interlocking checks. Prolonged
overvoltage may cause damage to voltage-sensitive equipment
(e.g. electronics), while undervoltage may cause excessive
current to be drawn by motor loads. Motors are provided with
thermal overload protection to prevent damage with excessive
current, but undervoltage protection is commonly applied to
disconnect motors after a prolonged voltage dip. With a voltage
dip caused by a source system fault, a group of motors could
decelerate to such a degree that their aggregate re-
acceleration currents might keep the recovery voltage
depressed to a level where the machines might stall. Modern
numerical motor protection relays typically incorporate voltage
protection functions, thus removing the need for discrete
undervoltage relays for this purpose. See Chapter [C.9: A.C.
Motor Protection]. Older installations may still utilise discrete
undervoltage relays, but the setting criteria remain the same.
Reverse phase sequence voltage protection should be applied
where it may be dangerous for a motor to be started with
rotation in the opposite direction to that intended. Incorrect
rotation due to reverse phase sequence might be set up
following some error after power system maintenance or
repairs, e.g. to a supply cable. Older motor control boards
might have been fitted with discrete relays to detect this
condition. Modern motor protection relays may incorporate
this function. If reverse phase sequence is detected, motor
starting can be blocked. If reverse phase sequence voltage
protection is not provided, the high-set negative phase
sequence current protection in the relay would quickly detect
the condition once the starting device is closed – but initial
reverse rotation of the motor could not be prevented.

If the kW load and uncorrected power factors are known,
then the capacitor rating in kvar to achieve a given degree
of correction may be calculated from:
Capacitor kvar = kW x (tan∠φ1 - tan∠φ2 )
A spreadsheet can easily be constructed to calculate the
required amount of compensation to achieve a desired power
factor.
11.1 Capacitor control
Where the plant load or the plant power factor varies
considerably, it is necessary to control the power factor
correction, since over-correction will result in excessive system
voltage and unnecessary losses. In a few industrial systems,
capacitors are switched in manually when required, but
automatic controllers are standard practice. A controller
provides automatic power factor correction, by comparing
the running power factor with the target value. Based on the
available groupings, an appropriate amount of capacitance
is switched in or out to maintain an optimum average power
factor. The controller is fitted with a ’loss of voltage’ relay
element to ensure that all selected capacitors are disconnected
instantaneously if there is a supply voltage interruption. When
the supply voltage is restored, the capacitors are reconnected
progressively as the plant starts up. To ensure that capacitor
groups degrade at roughly the same rate, the controller usually
rotates selection or randomly selects groups of the same size
in order to even out the connected time. The provision of
overvoltage protection to trip the capacitor bank is also
desirable in some applications. This would be to prevent a
severe system overvoltage if the power factor correction (PFC)
controller fails to take fast corrective action.
The design of PFC installations must recognise that many
industrial loads generate harmonic voltages, with the result
that the PFC capacitors may sink significant harmonic currents.
A harmonic study may be necessary to determine the capacitor
thermal ratings or whether series filters are required.
11.2 Motor power factor correction
When dealing with power factor correction of motor loads,
group correction is not always the most economical method.
Some industrial consumers apply capacitors to selected motor
substations rather than applying all of the correction at the
main incoming substation busbars. Sometimes, power factor
correction may even be applied to individual motors, resulting
in optimum power factor being obtained under all conditions
of aggregate motor load. In some instances, better motor
starting may also result, from the improvement in the voltage
regulation due to the capacitor. Motor capacitors are often
six-terminal units, and a capacitor may be conveniently
connected directly across each motor phase winding.
Capacitor sizing is important, such that a leading power factor
does not occur under any load condition. If excess capacitance
is applied to a motor, it may be possible for self-excitation to
occur when the motor is switched off or suffers a supply
11. Power factor correction and protection of capacitors
failure. This can result in the production of a high voltage or
in mechanical damage if there is a sudden restoration of
supply. Since most star/delta or auto-transformer starters
other than the ‘Korndorffer’ types involve a transitional break
in supply, it is generally recommended that the capacitor
rating should not exceed 85% of the motor magnetising
reactive power.
11.3 Capacitor protection
When considering protection for capacitors, allowance should
be made for the transient inrush current occurring on switch-
on, since this can reach peak values of around 20 times
normal current. Switchgear for use with capacitors is usually
de-rated considerably to allow for this. Inrush currents may
be limited by a resistor in series with each capacitor or bank
of capacitors.
Protection equipment is required to prevent rupture of the
capacitor due to an internal fault and also to protect the cables
and associated equipment from damage in case of a capacitor
failure. If fuse protection is contemplated for a three-phase
capacitor, HRC fuses should be employed with a current rating
of not less than 1.5 times the rated capacitor current.
Medium voltage capacitor banks can be protected by the
scheme shown in Figure B3.15. Since harmonics increase
capacitor current, the relay will respond more correctly if it
does not have in-built tuning for harmonic rejection.
Double star capacitor banks are employed at medium voltage.
As shown in Figure B3.16, a current transformer in the inter
star-point connection can be used to drive a protection relay
to detect the out-of-balance currents that will flow when
capacitor elements become short-circuited or open-circuited.
The relay will have adjustable current settings, and it might
contain a bias circuit, fed from an external voltage transformer,
that can be adjusted to compensate for steady-state spill
current in the inter star-point connection.
Some industrial loads such as arc furnaces involve large
inductive components and correction is often applied using
very large high voltage capacitors in various configurations.
Another high voltage capacitor configuration is the ‘split phase’
arrangement where the elements making up each phase of
the capacitor are split into two parallel paths. Figure B3.17
shows two possible connection methods for the relay. A
differential relay can be applied with a current transformer
for each parallel branch, comparing the currents in the split
phases. Alternatively an overcurrent relay can be applied with
a current transformer in the bridge link, where normally no
current should flow. Both relays use sensitive current settings
but also adjustable compensation for the unbalance currents
arising from initial capacitor mismatch.
The difference of current through the split phases or the
increase of the current through the bridge link indicates a
defect of a single capacitor unit ‘can’ where the amount of
additional current is directly dependent on the can dimensions.
less than just after fault occurrence. In rare situations, it may have to be taken into
account for correct time grading for through-fault protection considerations, and in the
peak voltage calculation for high impedance differential protection configurations.
It is more important to take motor contribution into account when considering
equipment fault rating (busbars, cables, switchgear, etc.). Typically, the initial AC
motor current component at the instant of fault is of similar magnitude to the direct-on-
line motor starting current. For LV motors, 5xFLC is assumed as the common fault
current contribution (after considering the effect of motor cable impedance), with
5.5xFLC for HV motors, unless it is known that low starting current HV motors are
installed. It is also common that similar motors connected to a busbar can be lumped
together as one equivalent motor. In doing so, motor rated speed may need to be
considered, as 2 or 4 pole motors have a longer fault current decay than motors with
a higher number of poles. The kVA rating of the single equivalent motor is taken as
the sum of the kVA ratings of the individual motors. It is still possible for motor
contribution to be ignored in situations where the motor load on a busbar is insignificant
in comparison to the total load (again IEC 60909 gives guidance in this respect).
Nevertheless, big LV motor loads and all HV motors should be considered when
calculating fault levels.
AUTOMATIC CHANGEOVER SYSTEMS
Induction motors are typically used to drive critical loads. In some plants, such as those
involving the pumping of fluids and gases, this has led to the need for a power supply
control configuration in which motor and other loads are automatically transferred on
loss of the normal supply to an optional supply. A fast changeover, allowing the motor
load to be re-accelerated, decreases the possibility of a process trip happening. Such
configurations are typically used for big generating units to transfer unit loads from the
unit transformer to the station supply/start-up transformer. When the normal supply
fails, induction motors that stay connected to the busbar slow down and the trapped
rotor flux creates a residual voltage that exponentially decays. All motors connected
to a busbar will start to decelerate at the same rate when the supply is lost if they stay
connected to the busbar. This happens because the motors will exchange energy
between themselves, so that they tend to stay ‘synchronized’ to each other.
Industrial System Protection – D04-003
21
Consequently, the residual voltages of all the motors decay at nearly the same rate.
The magnitude of this voltage and its phase displacement with respect to the healthy
alternative supply voltage is a function of time and the motor speed. The angular
displacement between the residual motor voltage and the incoming voltage will be
180° at some instant. If the healthy back-up supply is switched on to motors which are
running down under these conditions, very high inrush currents may happen,
generating stresses which could be of adequate magnitude to cause mechanical
stress, as well as a severe dip in the back-up supply voltage.
Two automatic transfer methods are applied:
- in-phase transfer system
- residual voltage system
The in-phase transfer method is presented in Figure 10(a). Normal and standby
feeders from the same power source are used.
Phase angle measurement is applied to discover the relative phase angle between the
standby feeder voltage and the motor busbar voltage. When the voltages are in phase
or just prior to this condition, a high speed circuit breaker is used to complete the
transfer. This approach is restricted to big high inertia drives where the gradual run
down characteristic upon loss of normal feeder supply can be accurately anticipated.
Figure 10(b) presents the residual voltage method, which is more typical, particularly
in the petrochemical industry. Two feeders are used, feeding two busbar sections
connected by a normally open bus section breaker. Each line is capable of transferring
the total busbar load. Each bus section voltage is monitored and loss of supply on
either section causes the relevant incomer CB to open. Given there are no protection
operations to show the presence of a busbar fault, the bus section breaker is
automatically closed to restore the supply to the unpowered busbar section of after the
residual voltage created by the motors running down on that section has decreased to
a an acceptable level.

This is between 25% and 40%, of nominal voltage, dependent on the power system
characteristics. The residual voltage setting selection will affect the re-acceleration
current after the bus section breaker closes. For example, a setting of 25% may be
anticipated to result in an inrush current of around 125% of the starting current at full
voltage. Optionally, a time delay could be used as a residual voltage measurement
substitute, which would be set with knowledge of the plant to make sure that the
residual voltage would have sufficiently decreased before transfer is started. The
protection relay settings for the switchboard must take account of the total load current

and the voltage dip during the re-acceleration period in order to avert spurious tripping
during this time. This time can be few seconds where big inertia HV drives are used.
VOLTAGE AND PHASE REVERSAL PROTECTION
Voltage protection relays have been widely used in industrial power supply systems.
The principle detects under-voltage and/or overvoltage conditions at switchboards and
disconnects supplies before damage happens. Continued overvoltage may create
damage to voltage-sensitive devices (e.g. electronics), while under-voltage may
create excessive current to be taken by motor loads. Motors are equipped with thermal
overload protection to avert excessive current damage, but under-voltage protection
is typically used to disconnect motors after a prolonged voltage dip. With a voltage dip
made by a source system fault, a group of motors could decelerate to such a degree
that their aggregate reacceleration currents might keep the recovery voltage
depressed to a level where the motors might stall. Modern numerical motor protection
relays usually contain voltage protection functions, therefore removing the need for
discrete under-voltage protection relays. Previous installations may still utilize discrete
under-voltage protection relays, but the setting criteria stay the same.
Reverse phase sequence voltage protection should be used where it may be difficult
for a motor to be started with rotation in the opposite direction. Incorrect rotation due
to reverse phase sequence might be set up following error after power system
maintenance or repairs. Older motor control switchboards might have been equipped
with discrete protection relays to discover this condition. Modern motor protection
relays may use this function. If reverse phase sequence is discovered, motor starting
can be stopped. If reverse phase sequence voltage protection is not given, the high-
set negative phase sequence current protection in the protection relay would promptly
discover the condition once the starting device is closed – but motor initial reverse
rotation could not be stopped.

adjustable current settings, and it might have a bias circuit, supplied from an external
voltage transformer, that can be adjusted to compensate for steady-state spill current
in the inter star-point connection.

Some industrial loads such as arc furnaces require large inductive components and
correction is usually provided using very large, high voltage capacitors in different
arrangements. Another high voltage capacitor arrangement is the ‘split phase’
configuration where the elements making up each phase of the capacitor are
separated into two parallel paths. Figure 14 presents two possible relay connection
arrangements. A differential protection relay can be used with a current transformer
for each parallel branch. The protection relay compares the current in the split phases,
using sensitive current settings but also adjustable compensation for the unbalance
currents arising from initial capacitor mismatch.

Processing is a free graphics library and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching non-programmers the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context. 
Processing uses the Java language, with additional simplifications such as additional classes and aliased mathematical functions and operations. It also provides a graphical user interface for simplifying the compilation and execution stage. 
The Processing language and IDE have been the precursor to other projects including Arduino and Wiring. 
History
The project was initiated in 2001 by Casey Reas and Ben Fry, both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab. In 2012, they started the Processing Foundation along with Daniel Shiffman, who joined as a third project lead. Johanna Hedva joined the Foundation in 2014 as Director of Advocacy.[2] 
Originally, Processing had used the domain proce55ing.net, because the processing domain was taken; Reas and Fry eventually acquired the domain processing.org and moved the project to it in 2004.[3] While the original name had a combination of letters and numbers, it was always officially referred to as processing, but the abbreviated term p5 is still occasionally used (e.g. in "p5.js") in reference to the old domain name.[4] 
In 2012 the Processing Foundation was established and received 501(c)(3) nonprofit status,[5] supporting the community around the tools and ideas that started with the Processing Project. The foundation encourages people around the world to meet annually in local events called Processing Community Day.[6]

Website	processing.org

Processing includes a sketchbook, a minimal alternative to an integrated development environment (IDE) for organizing projects.[7] 
Every Processing sketch is actually a subclass of the PApplet Java class (formerly a subclass of Java's built-in Applet) which implements most of the Processing language's features.[8] 
When programming in Processing, all additional classes defined will be treated as inner classes when the code is translated into pure Java before compiling.[9] This means that the use of static variables and methods in classes is prohibited unless Processing is explicitly told to code in pure Java mode. 
Processing also allows for users to create their own classes within the PApplet sketch. This allows for complex data types that can include any number of arguments and avoids the limitations of solely using standard data types such as: int (integer), char (character), float (real number), and color (RGB, RGBA, hex). 
Examples
The simplest possible version of a "Hello World" program in Processing is: 
// This prints "Hello World." to the IDE console.
println("Hello World.");
However, due to the more visually-oriented nature of Processing, the following code[10] is a better example of the look and feel of the language. 
// Hello mouse.
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
  stroke(255);
  background(192, 64, 0);
}

void draw() {
  line(150, 25, mouseX, mouseY);
}
Awards
In 2005 Reas and Fry won the Golden Nica award from Ars Electronica in its Net Vision category for their work on Processing.[11] 
Ben Fry won the 2011 National Design Award given by the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in the category of Interaction Design. The award statement says: 
"Drawing on a background in graphic design and computer science, Ben Fry pursues a long-held fascination with visualizing data. As Principal of Fathom Information Design in Boston, Fry develops software, printed works, installations, and books that depict and explain topics from the human genome to baseball salaries to the evolution of text documents. With Casey Reas, he founded the Processing Project, an open-source programming environment for teaching computational design and sketching interactive-media software. It provides artists and designers with accessible means of working with code while encouraging engineers and computer scientists to think about design concepts."[12]

Processing.js
Processing.js is a discontinued JavaScript port that enabled existing Processing Java code to run on web. 
It was initially released in 2008 by John Resig. The project was later run through a partnership between the Mozilla Foundation and Seneca College, led by David Humphrey, Al MacDonald, and Corban Brook. Processing.js was kept at parity with Processing up to its API version 2.1 release. 
The project was discontinued in December 2018, two years after its active development had stopped. 
P5Py
p5 is a Python library that provides high level drawing functionality to help you quickly create simulations and interactive art using Python. It combines the core ideas of Processing — learning to code in a visual context — with Python's readability to make programming more accessible to beginners, educators, and artists.[15] 
Processing.py
Python Mode for Processing, or Processing.py is a Python interface to the underlying Java toolkit. It was chiefly developed by Jonathan Feinberg starting in 2010, with contributions from James Gilles and Ben Alkov.[16] 
py5
py5 is a version of Processing for Python 3.8+. It makes the Java Processing jars available to the CPython interpreter using JPype. It can do just about everything Processing can do, except with Python instead of Java code.[17] 
Wiring, Arduino, and Fritzing
Processing has spawned another project, Wiring, which uses the Processing IDE with a collection of libraries written in the C++ language as a way to teach artists how to program microcontrollers.[18] There are now two separate hardware projects, Wiring and Arduino, using the Wiring environment and language. Fritzing is another software environment of the same sort, which helps designers and artists to document their interactive prototypes and to take the step from physical prototyping to actual product. 
Mobile Processing
Another spin-off project, now defunct, is Mobile Processing by Francis Li, which allowed software written using the Processing language and environment to run on Java powered mobile devices. Today some of the same functionality is provided by Processing itself.[19] 
iProcessing
iProcessing was built to help people develop native iPhone applications using the Processing language. It is an integration of the Processing.js library and a Javascript application framework for iPhone.[20] 
Spde
Spde (Scala Processing Development Environment) replaces Processing's reduced Java syntax and custom preprocessor with the off-the-shelf Scala programming language which also runs on the Java platform and enforces some of the same restrictions such as disallowing static methods, while also allowing more concise code, and supporting functional programming.[21][22][23] 
JRubyArt
JRubyArt (formerly named ruby-processing) is a wrapper for Processing in the Ruby language, that runs on the Java platform using JRuby. 
Quil
Quil is an interactive animation library for Clojure and ClojureScript based on Processing.[24][25] 
Media
The music video for "House of Cards" by Radiohead was created using Processing combined with data from lidar technology, along with using acrylic glass and mirrors to create scenes in which the image appears distorted, partially disappears, or disintegrate as if being carried by wind.[26] Processing has also been used to create illustrations for publications such as Nature and The New York Times, to output sculptures for gallery exhibitions, to control huge video walls and to knit sweaters.[27]

 An Integrated circuit (IC) as an example application in the field of microelectronics. The chip housing is opened to allow a view of the actual circuit. The golden connecting cables, which form the electrical wiring between the IC and the housing contacts, can be seen on the sides. 
Microelectronics is a subfield of electronics. As the name suggests, microelectronics relates to the study and manufacture (or microfabrication) of very small electronic designs and components. Usually, but not always, this means micrometre-scale or smaller. These devices are typically made from semiconductor materials. Many components of a normal electronic design are available in a microelectronic equivalent. These include transistors, capacitors, inductors, resistors, diodes and (naturally) insulators and conductors can all be found in microelectronic devices. Unique wiring techniques such as wire bonding are also often used in microelectronics because of the unusually small size of the components, leads and pads. This technique requires specialized equipment and is expensive. 
Digital integrated circuits (ICs) consist of billions of transistors, resistors, diodes, and capacitors.[1] Analog circuits commonly contain resistors and capacitors as well. Inductors are used in some high frequency analog circuits, but tend to occupy larger chip area due to their lower reactance at low frequencies. Gyrators can replace them in many applications. 
As techniques have improved, the scale of microelectronic components has continued to decrease.[2] At smaller scales, the relative impact of intrinsic circuit properties such as interconnections may become more significant. These are called parasitic effects, and the goal of the microelectronics design engineer is to find ways to compensate for or to minimize these effects, while delivering smaller, faster, and cheaper devices. 
Today, microelectronics design is largely aided by Electronic Design Automation software.

	Image Reconstruction Techniques
Lifeng Yu, PhD Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN

(Updated Sept. 2016)
Image reconstruction in CT is a mathematical process that generates tomographic images from X-ray projection
data acquired at many different angles around the patient. Image reconstruction has fundamental impacts on
image quality and therefore on radiation dose. For a given radiation dose it is desirable to reconstruct images
with the lowest possible noise without sacrificing image accuracy and spatial resolution. Reconstructions that
improve image quality can be translated into a reduction of radiation dose because images of the same quality
can be reconstructed at lower dose.
Two major categories of reconstruction methods exist, analytical reconstruction and iterative reconstruction
(IR). Let’s focus on the analytical reconstruction methods at first. There are many types of analytical
reconstruction methods. The most commonly used analytical reconstruction methods on commercial CT
scanners are all in the form of filtered backprojection (FBP), which uses a 1D filter on the projection data before
backprojecting (2D or 3D) the data onto the image space. The popularity of FBP-type of method is mainly
because of its computational efficiency and numerical stability. Various FBP-type of analytical reconstruction
methods were developed for different generations of CT data-acquisition geometries, from 2D parallel- and fan-
beam CT in the 1970s and 1980s to helical and multi-slice CT with narrow detector coverage in late 1990s and
early 2000s, and to multi-slice CT with a wide detector coverage (up to 320 detector rows and 16 cm width). 3D
weighted FBP methods are generally adopted on scanners with more than 16 detector rows [1]. For a general
introduction of the fundamental principles of CT image reconstruction, please refer to Chapter 3 in Kak and
Slaney’s book [2]. An introduction to reconstruction methods in helical and multi-slice CT can be found in Hsieh’s
	book [3]. A review of analytical CT image reconstruction methods used on clinical CT scanners can be found in
the article by Flohr, et al [4].
Users of clinical CT scanners usually have very limited control over the inner workings of the reconstruction
method and are confined principally to adjusting various parameters that potentially affect image quality. The
reconstruction kernel, also referred to as “filter” or “algorithm” by some CT vendors, is one of the most
important parameters that affect the image quality. Generally speaking, there is a tradeoff between spatial
resolution and noise for each kernel. A smoother kernel generates images with lower noise but with reduced
spatial resolution. A sharper kernel generates images with higher spatial resolution, but increases the image
noise.
The selection of reconstruction kernel should be based on specific clinical applications. For example, smooth
kernels are usually used in brain exams or liver tumor assessment to reduce image noise and enhance low
contrast detectability, whereas sharper kernels are usually used in exams to assess bony structures due to the
clinical requirement of better spatial resolution.
Another important reconstruction parameter is slice thickness, which controls the spatial resolution in the
longitudinal direction, influencing the tradeoffs among resolution, noise, and radiation dose. It is the
responsibility of CT users to select the most appropriate reconstruction kernel and slice thickness for each
clinical application so that the radiation dose can be minimized consistent with the image quality needed for the
examination.
In addition to the conventional reconstruction kernels applied during image reconstruction, many noise
reduction techniques, operating on image or projection data, are also available on commercial scanners or as
third-party products. Many of these methods involve non-linear de-noising filters, some of which have been
combined into the reconstruction kernels for the users’ convenience. In some applications these methods
	perform quite well to reduce image noise while maintaining high-contrast resolution. If applied too aggressively,
however, they tend to change the noise texture and sacrifice the low-contrast detectability in the image.
Therefore, careful evaluation of these filters should be performed for each diagnostic task before they are
deployed into wide-scale clinical usage.
Scanning techniques and image reconstructions in ECG-gated cardiac CT have a unique impact on image quality
and radiation dose. Half-scan (or short-scan) reconstruction is typically used to obtain better temporal
resolution. For the widely employed retrospective ECG-gated helical scan mode, the helical pitch is very low
(~0.2 to 0.3) in order to avoid anatomical discontinuities between contiguous heart cycles. A significant dose
reduction technique in helical cardiac scanning is ECG tube-current pulsing, which involves modulating the tube
current down to 4% to 20% of the full tube current for phases that are of minimal interest. Prospective ECG-
triggered sequential (or step-and-shoot) scans are a more dose-efficient scanning mode for cardiac CT, especially
for single-phase studies. An overview of scanning and reconstruction techniques in cardiac CT can be found in an
article by Flohr et al [5].
Different from analytical reconstruction methods, IR reconstructs images by iteratively optimizing an objective
function, which typically consists of a data fidelity term and an edge-preserving regularization term [6]. The
optimization process in IR involves iterations of forward projection and backprojection between image space
and projection space. With the advances in computing technology, IR has become a very popular choice in
routine CT practice because it has many advantages compared with conventional FBP techniques. Important
physical factors including focal spot and detector geometry, photon statistics, X-ray beam spectrum, and
scattering can be more accurately incorporated into IR, yielding lower image noise and higher spatial resolution
compared with FBP. In addition, IR can reduce image artifacts such as beam hardening, windmill, and metal
artifacts.
	Due to the intrinsic difference in data handling between FBP and iterative reconstruction, images from IR may
have a different appearance (e.g., noise texture) from those using FBP reconstruction. More importantly, the
spatial resolution in a local region of IR-reconstructed images is highly dependent on the contrast and noise of
the surrounding structures due to the non-linear regularization term and other factors during the optimization
process [7]. Measurements on different commercial IR methods have demonstrated this contrast- and noise-
dependency of spatial resolution [8,9]. Because of this dependency, the amount of potential radiation dose
reduction allowable by IR is dependent on the diagnostic task since the contrast of the subject and the noise of
the exam vary substantially in clinical exams [10]. For low-contrast detection tasks, several phantom and human
observer studies on multiple commercial IR methods demonstrated that only marginal or a small amount of
radiation dose reduction can be allowed [11,12,13]. Careful clinical evaluation and reconstruction parameter
optimization are required before IR can be used in routine practice [10,14,15]. Task-based image quality
evaluation using model observers have been actively investigated so that image quality and dose reduction can
be quantified objectively in an efficient manner [16,17,18].

Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining millions or billions of MOS transistors onto a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when MOS integrated circuit (metal oxide semiconductor) chips were developed and then widely adopted, enabling complex semiconductor and telecommunications technologies. The microprocessor and memory chips are VLSI devices. 
Before the introduction of VLSI technology, most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU, ROM, RAM and other glue logic. VLSI enables IC designers to add all of these into one chip.

History
Background
The history of the transistor dates to the 1920s when several inventors attempted devices that were intended to control current in solid-state diodes and convert them into triodes. Success came after World War II, when the use of silicon and germanium crystals as radar detectors led to improvements in fabrication and theory. Scientists who had worked on radar returned to solid-state device development. With the invention of the first transistor at Bell Labs in 1947, the field of electronics shifted from vacuum tubes to solid-state devices.[1] 
With the small transistor at their hands, electrical engineers of the 1950s saw the possibilities of constructing far more advanced circuits. However, as the complexity of circuits grew, problems arose.[2] One problem was the size of the circuit. A complex circuit like a computer was dependent on speed. If the components were large, the wires interconnecting them must be long. The electric signals took time to go through the circuit, thus slowing the computer.[2] 
The invention of the integrated circuit by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce solved this problem by making all the components and the chip out of the same block (monolith) of semiconductor material.[3] The circuits could be made smaller, and the manufacturing process could be automated. This led to the idea of integrating all components on a single-crystal silicon wafer, which led to small-scale integration (SSI) in the early 1960s, and then medium-scale integration (MSI) in the late 1960s.[4] 
VLSI
See also: MOS integrated circuit
General Microelectronics introduced the first commercial MOS integrated circuit in 1964.[5] In the early 1970s, MOS integrated circuit technology allowed the integration of more than 10,000 transistors in a single chip.[6] This paved the way for VLSI in the 1970s and 1980s, with tens of thousands of MOS transistors on a single chip (later hundreds of thousands, then millions, and now billions). 
The first semiconductor chips held two transistors each. Subsequent advances added more transistors, and as a consequence, more individual functions or systems were integrated over time. The first integrated circuits held only a few devices, perhaps as many as ten diodes, transistors, resistors and capacitors, making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device. Now known retrospectively as small-scale integration (SSI), improvements in technique led to devices with hundreds of logic gates, known as medium-scale integration (MSI). Further improvements led to large-scale integration (LSI), i.e. systems with at least a thousand logic gates. Current technology has moved far past this mark and today's microprocessors have many millions of gates and billions of individual transistors. 
At one time, there was an effort to name and calibrate various levels of large-scale integration above VLSI. Terms like ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI) were used. But the huge number of gates and transistors available on common devices has rendered such fine distinctions moot. Terms suggesting greater than VLSI levels of integration are no longer in widespread use. 
In 2008, billion-transistor processors became commercially available. This became more commonplace as semiconductor fabrication advanced from the then-current generation of 65 nm processors. Current designs, unlike the earliest devices, use extensive design automation and automated logic synthesis to lay out the transistors, enabling higher levels of complexity in the resulting logic functionality.

"Parallelization" redirects here. For parallelization of manifolds, see Parallelization (mathematics).
 Large supercomputers such as IBM's Blue Gene/P are designed to heavily exploit parallelism. 
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously.[1] Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but has gained broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling.[2] As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,[3] parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.[4] 
 Parallelism vs concurrency 
In computer science, parallelism and concurrency are two different things: a parallel program uses multiple CPU cores, each core performing a task independently. On the other hand, concurrency enables a program to deal with multiple tasks even on a single CPU core; the core switches between tasks (i.e. threads) without necessarily completing each one. A program can have both, neither or a combination of parallelism and concurrency characteristics.[5] 
Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters, MPPs, and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task. Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks. 
In some cases parallelism is transparent to the programmer, such as in bit-level or instruction-level parallelism, but explicitly parallel algorithms, particularly those that use concurrency, are more difficult to write than sequential ones,[6] because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race conditions are the most common. Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest obstacles to getting optimal parallel program performance. 
A theoretical upper bound on the speed-up of a single program as a result of parallelization is given by Amdahl's law, which states that it is limited by the fraction of time for which the parallelization can be utilised. 
Background
Traditionally, computer software has been written for serial computation. To solve a problem, an algorithm is constructed and implemented as a serial stream of instructions. These instructions are executed on a central processing unit on one computer. Only one instruction may execute at a time—after that instruction is finished, the next one is executed.[7] 
Parallel computing, on the other hand, uses multiple processing elements simultaneously to solve a problem. This is accomplished by breaking the problem into independent parts so that each processing element can execute its part of the algorithm simultaneously with the others. The processing elements can be diverse and include resources such as a single computer with multiple processors, several networked computers, specialized hardware, or any combination of the above.[7] Historically parallel computing was used for scientific computing and the simulation of scientific problems, particularly in the natural and engineering sciences, such as meteorology. This led to the design of parallel hardware and software, as well as high performance computing.[8] 
Frequency scaling was the dominant reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime of a program is equal to the number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average time it takes to execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.[9] However, power consumption P by a chip is given by the equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle (proportional to the number of transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second).[10] Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor power consumption led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.[11] 
To deal with the problem of power consumption and overheating the major central processing unit (CPU or processor) manufacturers started to produce power efficient processors with multiple cores. The core is the computing unit of the processor and in multi-core processors each core is independent and can access the same memory concurrently. Multi-core processors have brought parallel computing to desktop computers. Thus parallelization of serial programs has become a mainstream programming task. In 2012 quad-core processors became standard for desktop computers, while servers have 10+ core processors. From Moore's law it can be predicted that the number of cores per processor will double every 18–24 months. This could mean that after 2020 a typical processor will have dozens or hundreds of cores, however in reality the standard is somewhere in the region of 4 to 16 cores, with some designs having a mix of performance and efficiency cores (such as ARM's big.LITTLE design) due to thermal and design constraints.[12][citation needed] 
An operating system can ensure that different tasks and user programs are run in parallel on the available cores. However, for a serial software program to take full advantage of the multi-core architecture the programmer needs to restructure and parallelize the code. A speed-up of application software runtime will no longer be achieved through frequency scaling, instead programmers will need to parallelize their software code to take advantage of the increasing computing power of multicore architectures.[13] 
Relevant laws
 A graphical representation of Amdahl's law. The law demonstrates the theoretical maximum speedup of an overall system and the concept of diminishing returns. If exactly 50% of the work can be parallelized, the best possible speedup is 2 times. If 95% of the work can be parallelized, the best possible speedup is 20 times. According to the law, even with an infinite number of processors, the speedup is constrained by the unparallelizable portion.  Assume that a task has two independent parts, A and B. Part B takes roughly 25% of the time of the whole computation. By working very hard, one may be able to make this part 5 times faster, but this only reduces the time for the whole computation by a little. In contrast, one may need to perform less work to make part A twice as fast. This will make the computation much faster than by optimizing part B, even though part B's speedup is greater by ratio, (5 times versus 2 times). 
Main article: Amdahl's law 
Optimally, the speedup from parallelization would be linear—doubling the number of processing elements should halve the runtime, and doubling it a second time should again halve the runtime. However, very few parallel algorithms achieve optimal speedup. Most of them have a near-linear speedup for small numbers of processing elements, which flattens out into a constant value for large numbers of processing elements. 
The maximum potential speedup of an overall system can be calculated by Amdahl's law. [14] Amdahl's Law indicates that optimal performance improvement is achieved by balancing enhancements to both parallelizable and non-parallelizable components of a task. Furthermore, it reveals that increasing the number of processors yields diminishing returns, with negligible speedup gains beyond a certain point. [15][16] 
Amdahl's Law has limitations, including assumptions of fixed workload, neglecting inter-process communication and synchronization overheads, primarily focusing on computational aspect and ignoring extrinsic factors such as data persistence, I/O operations, and memory access overheads. [17][18][19] 
Gustafson's law and Universal Scalability Law give a more realistic assessment of the parallel performance. [20][21]
 A graphical representation of Gustafson's law 
Dependencies
Understanding data dependencies is fundamental in implementing parallel algorithms. No program can run more quickly than the longest chain of dependent calculations (known as the critical path), since calculations that depend upon prior calculations in the chain must be executed in order. However, most algorithms do not consist of just a long chain of dependent calculations; there are usually opportunities to execute independent calculations in parallel. 
Let Pi and Pj be two program segments. Bernstein's conditions[22] describe when the two are independent and can be executed in parallel. For Pi, let Ii be all of the input variables and Oi the output variables, and likewise for Pj. Pi and Pj are independent if they satisfy 
 
 
 
Violation of the first condition introduces a flow dependency, corresponding to the first segment producing a result used by the second segment. The second condition represents an anti-dependency, when the second segment produces a variable needed by the first segment. The third and final condition represents an output dependency: when two segments write to the same location, the result comes from the logically last executed segment.[23] 
Consider the following functions, which demonstrate several kinds of dependencies: 
1: function Dep(a, b)
2: c := a * b
3: d := 3 * c
4: end function
In this example, instruction 3 cannot be executed before (or even in parallel with) instruction 2, because instruction 3 uses a result from instruction 2. It violates condition 1, and thus introduces a flow dependency. 
1: function NoDep(a, b)
2: c := a * b
3: d := 3 * b
4: e := a + b
5: end function
In this example, there are no dependencies between the instructions, so they can all be run in parallel. 
Bernstein's conditions do not allow memory to be shared between different processes. For that, some means of enforcing an ordering between accesses is necessary, such as semaphores, barriers or some other synchronization method. 
Race conditions, mutual exclusion, synchronization, and parallel slowdown
Subtasks in a parallel program are often called threads. Some parallel computer architectures use smaller, lightweight versions of threads known as fibers, while others use bigger versions known as processes. However, "threads" is generally accepted as a generic term for subtasks.[24] Threads will often need synchronized access to an object or other resource, for example when they must update a variable that is shared between them. Without synchronization, the instructions between the two threads may be interleaved in any order. For example, consider the following program: 
Thread A 	Thread B 
1A: Read variable V 	1B: Read variable V 
2A: Add 1 to variable V 	2B: Add 1 to variable V 
3A: Write back to variable V 	3B: Write back to variable V 
If instruction 1B is executed between 1A and 3A, or if instruction 1A is executed between 1B and 3B, the program will produce incorrect data. This is known as a race condition. The programmer must use a lock to provide mutual exclusion. A lock is a programming language construct that allows one thread to take control of a variable and prevent other threads from reading or writing it, until that variable is unlocked. The thread holding the lock is free to execute its critical section (the section of a program that requires exclusive access to some variable), and to unlock the data when it is finished. Therefore, to guarantee correct program execution, the above program can be rewritten to use locks: 
Thread A 	Thread B 
1A: Lock variable V 	1B: Lock variable V 
2A: Read variable V 	2B: Read variable V 
3A: Add 1 to variable V 	3B: Add 1 to variable V 
4A: Write back to variable V 	4B: Write back to variable V 
5A: Unlock variable V 	5B: Unlock variable V 
One thread will successfully lock variable V, while the other thread will be locked out—unable to proceed until V is unlocked again. This guarantees correct execution of the program. Locks may be necessary to ensure correct program execution when threads must serialize access to resources, but their use can greatly slow a program and may affect its reliability.[25] 
Locking multiple variables using non-atomic locks introduces the possibility of program deadlock. An atomic lock locks multiple variables all at once. If it cannot lock all of them, it does not lock any of them. If two threads each need to lock the same two variables using non-atomic locks, it is possible that one thread will lock one of them and the second thread will lock the second variable. In such a case, neither thread can complete, and deadlock results.[26] 
Many parallel programs require that their subtasks act in synchrony. This requires the use of a barrier. Barriers are typically implemented using a lock or a semaphore.[27] One class of algorithms, known as lock-free and wait-free algorithms, altogether avoids the use of locks and barriers. However, this approach is generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.[28] 
Not all parallelization results in speed-up. Generally, as a task is split up into more and more threads, those threads spend an ever-increasing portion of their time communicating with each other or waiting on each other for access to resources.[29][30] Once the overhead from resource contention or communication dominates the time spent on other computation, further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more threads) increases rather than decreases the amount of time required to finish. This problem, known as parallel slowdown,[31] can be improved in some cases by software analysis and redesign.[32] 
Fine-grained, coarse-grained, and embarrassing parallelism
Applications are often classified according to how often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism if they do not communicate many times per second, and it exhibits embarrassing parallelism if they rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize. 
Flynn's taxonomy
Main article: Flynn's taxonomy
Michael J. Flynn created one of the earliest classification systems for parallel (and sequential) computers and programs, now known as Flynn's taxonomy. Flynn classified programs and computers by whether they were operating using a single set or multiple sets of instructions, and whether or not those instructions were using a single set or multiple sets of data.

The single-instruction-single-data (SISD) classification is equivalent to an entirely sequential program. The single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) classification is analogous to doing the same operation repeatedly over a large data set. This is commonly done in signal processing applications. Multiple-instruction-single-data (MISD) is a rarely used classification. While computer architectures to deal with this were devised (such as systolic arrays), few applications that fit this class materialized. Multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) programs are by far the most common type of parallel programs. 
According to David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy, "Some machines are hybrids of these categories, of course, but this classic model has survived because it is simple, easy to understand, and gives a good first approximation. It is also—perhaps because of its understandability—the most widely used scheme."[34] 
Disadvantages
Parallel computing can incur significant overhead in practice, primarily due to the costs associated with merging data from multiple processes. Specifically, inter-process communication and synchronization can lead to overheads that are substantially higher—often by two or more orders of magnitude—compared to processing the same data on a single thread. [35][36][37] Therefore, the overall improvement should be carefully evaluated.

Bit-level parallelism
Main article: Bit-level parallelism
 Taiwania 3 of Taiwan, a parallel supercomputing device that joined COVID-19 research 
From the advent of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle.[38] Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word. For example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction. 
Historically, 4-bit microprocessors were replaced with 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit microprocessors. This trend generally came to an end with the introduction of 32-bit processors, which has been a standard in general-purpose computing for two decades. Not until the early 2000s, with the advent of x86-64 architectures, did 64-bit processors become commonplace. 
Instruction-level parallelism
Main article: Instruction-level parallelism
 A canonical processor without pipeline. It takes five clock cycles to complete one instruction and thus the processor can issue subscalar performance (IPC = 0.2 < 1). 
A computer program is, in essence, a stream of instructions executed by a processor. Without instruction-level parallelism, a processor can only issue less than one instruction per clock cycle (IPC < 1). These processors are known as subscalar processors. These instructions can be re-ordered and combined into groups which are then executed in parallel without changing the result of the program. This is known as instruction-level parallelism. Advances in instruction-level parallelism dominated computer architecture from the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s.[39] 
 A canonical five-stage pipelined processor. In the best case scenario, it takes one clock cycle to complete one instruction and thus the processor can issue scalar performance (IPC = 1). 
All modern processors have multi-stage instruction pipelines. Each stage in the pipeline corresponds to a different action the processor performs on that instruction in that stage; a processor with an N-stage pipeline can have up to N different instructions at different stages of completion and thus can issue one instruction per clock cycle (IPC = 1). These processors are known as scalar processors. The canonical example of a pipelined processor is a RISC processor, with five stages: instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode (ID), execute (EX), memory access (MEM), and register write back (WB). The Pentium 4 processor had a 35-stage pipeline.[40] 
 A canonical five-stage pipelined processor with two execution units. In the best case scenario, it takes one clock cycle to complete two instructions and thus the processor can issue superscalar performance (IPC = 2 > 1). 
Most modern processors also have multiple execution units. They usually combine this feature with pipelining and thus can issue more than one instruction per clock cycle (IPC > 1). These processors are known as superscalar processors. Superscalar processors differ from multi-core processors in that the several execution units are not entire processors (i.e. processing units). Instructions can be grouped together only if there is no data dependency between them. Scoreboarding and the Tomasulo algorithm (which is similar to scoreboarding but makes use of register renaming) are two of the most common techniques for implementing out-of-order execution and instruction-level parallelism. 
Task parallelism
Main article: Task parallelism
Task parallelisms is the characteristic of a parallel program that "entirely different calculations can be performed on either the same or different sets of data".[41] This contrasts with data parallelism, where the same calculation is performed on the same or different sets of data. Task parallelism involves the decomposition of a task into sub-tasks and then allocating each sub-task to a processor for execution. The processors would then execute these sub-tasks concurrently and often cooperatively. Task parallelism does not usually scale with the size of a problem.[42] 
Superword level parallelism
Superword level parallelism is a vectorization technique based on loop unrolling and basic block vectorization. It is distinct from loop vectorization algorithms in that it can exploit parallelism of inline code, such as manipulating coordinates, color channels or in loops unrolled by hand.[43] 
Hardware
Memory and communication
Main memory in a parallel computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space).[44] Distributed memory refers to the fact that the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory. On the supercomputers, distributed shared memory space can be implemented using the programming model such as PGAS. This model allows processes on one compute node to transparently access the remote memory of another compute node. All compute nodes are also connected to an external shared memory system via high-speed interconnect, such as Infiniband, this external shared memory system is known as burst buffer, which is typically built from arrays of non-volatile memory physically distributed across multiple I/O nodes. 
 A logical view of a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Processors in one directory can access that directory's memory with less latency than they can access memory in the other directory's memory. 
Computer architectures in which each element of main memory can be accessed with equal latency and bandwidth are known as uniform memory access (UMA) systems. Typically, that can be achieved only by a shared memory system, in which the memory is not physically distributed. A system that does not have this property is known as a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access. 
Computer systems make use of caches—small and fast memories located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value in more than one location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a cache coherency system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping is one of the most common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.[44] 
Processor–processor and processor–memory communication can be implemented in hardware in several ways, including via shared (either multiported or multiplexed) memory, a crossbar switch, a shared bus or an interconnect network of a myriad of topologies including star, ring, tree, hypercube, fat hypercube (a hypercube with more than one processor at a node), or n-dimensional mesh. 
Parallel computers based on interconnected networks need to have some kind of routing to enable the passing of messages between nodes that are not directly connected. The medium used for communication between the processors is likely to be hierarchical in large multiprocessor machines. 
Classes of parallel computers
Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism. This classification is broadly analogous to the distance between basic computing nodes. These are not mutually exclusive; for example, clusters of symmetric multiprocessors are relatively common. 
Multi-core computing
Main article: Multi-core processor
A multi-core processor is a processor that includes multiple processing units (called "cores") on the same chip. This processor differs from a superscalar processor, which includes multiple execution units and can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from one instruction stream (thread); in contrast, a multi-core processor can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from multiple instruction streams. IBM's Cell microprocessor, designed for use in the Sony PlayStation 3, is a prominent multi-core processor. Each core in a multi-core processor can potentially be superscalar as well—that is, on every clock cycle, each core can issue multiple instructions from one thread. 
Simultaneous multithreading (of which Intel's Hyper-Threading is the best known) was an early form of pseudo-multi-coreism. A processor capable of concurrent multithreading includes multiple execution units in the same processing unit—that is it has a superscalar architecture—and can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from multiple threads. Temporal multithreading on the other hand includes a single execution unit in the same processing unit and can issue one instruction at a time from multiple threads. 
Symmetric multiprocessing
Main article: Symmetric multiprocessing
A symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) is a computer system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus.[45] Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32 processors.[46] Because of the small size of the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.[45] 
Distributed computing
Main article: Distributed computing
A distributed computer (also known as a distributed memory multiprocessor) is a distributed memory computer system in which the processing elements are connected by a network. Distributed computers are highly scalable. The terms "concurrent computing", "parallel computing", and "distributed computing" have a lot of overlap, and no clear distinction exists between them.[47] The same system may be characterized both as "parallel" and "distributed"; the processors in a typical distributed system run concurrently in parallel.[48] 
Cluster computing
Main article: Computer cluster
 A Beowulf cluster 
A cluster is a group of loosely coupled computers that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer.[49] Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster do not have to be symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network.[50] Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. 87% of all Top500 supercomputers are clusters.[51] The remaining are Massively Parallel Processors, explained below. 
Because grid computing systems (described below) can easily handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically designed to handle more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more importantly, a low-latency interconnection network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network.[52] As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet. 
Massively parallel computing

 A cabinet from IBM's Blue Gene/L massively parallel supercomputer 
A massively parallel processor (MPP) is a single computer with many networked processors. MPPs have many of the same characteristics as clusters, but MPPs have specialized interconnect networks (whereas clusters use commodity hardware for networking). MPPs also tend to be larger than clusters, typically having "far more" than 100 processors.[53] In an MPP, "each CPU contains its own memory and copy of the operating system and application. Each subsystem communicates with the others via a high-speed interconnect."[54] 
IBM's Blue Gene/L, the fifth fastest supercomputer in the world according to the June 2009 TOP500 ranking, is an MPP. 
Grid computing
Main article: Grid computing
Grid computing is the most distributed form of parallel computing. It makes use of computers communicating over the Internet to work on a given problem. Because of the low bandwidth and extremely high latency available on the Internet, distributed computing typically deals only with embarrassingly parallel problems. 
Most grid computing applications use middleware (software that sits between the operating system and the application to manage network resources and standardize the software interface). The most common grid computing middleware is the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). Often volunteer computing software makes use of "spare cycles", performing computations at times when a computer is idling.[55] 
Cloud computing
Main article: Cloud computing
The ubiquity of Internet brought the possibility of large-scale cloud computing. 
Specialized parallel computers
Within parallel computing, there are specialized parallel devices that remain niche areas of interest. While not domain-specific, they tend to be applicable to only a few classes of parallel problems. 
Reconfigurable computing with field-programmable gate arrays
Reconfigurable computing is the use of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) as a co-processor to a general-purpose computer. An FPGA is, in essence, a computer chip that can rewire itself for a given task. 
FPGAs can be programmed with hardware description languages such as VHDL[56] or Verilog.[57] Several vendors have created C to HDL languages that attempt to emulate the syntax and semantics of the C programming language, with which most programmers are familiar. The best known C to HDL languages are Mitrion-C, Impulse C, and Handel-C. Specific subsets of SystemC based on C++ can also be used for this purpose. 
AMD's decision to open its HyperTransport technology to third-party vendors has become the enabling technology for high-performance reconfigurable computing.[58] According to Michael R. D'Amour, Chief Operating Officer of DRC Computer Corporation, "when we first walked into AMD, they called us 'the socket stealers.' Now they call us their partners."[58] 
General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU)
Main article: GPGPU
 Nvidia's Tesla GPGPU card 
General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is a fairly recent trend in computer engineering research. GPUs are co-processors that have been heavily optimized for computer graphics processing.[59] Computer graphics processing is a field dominated by data parallel operations—particularly linear algebra matrix operations. 
In the early days, GPGPU programs used the normal graphics APIs for executing programs. However, several new programming languages and platforms have been built to do general purpose computation on GPUs with both Nvidia and AMD releasing programming environments with CUDA and Stream SDK respectively. Other GPU programming languages include BrookGPU, PeakStream, and RapidMind. Nvidia has also released specific products for computation in their Tesla series. The technology consortium Khronos Group has released the OpenCL specification, which is a framework for writing programs that execute across platforms consisting of CPUs and GPUs. AMD, Apple, Intel, Nvidia and others are supporting OpenCL. 
Application-specific integrated circuits
Main article: Application-specific integrated circuit
Several application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) approaches have been devised for dealing with parallel applications.[60][61][62] 
Because an ASIC is (by definition) specific to a given application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are created by UV photolithography. This process requires a mask set, which can be extremely expensive. A mask set can cost over a million US dollars.[63] (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by Moore's law) tend to wipe out these gains in only one or two chip generations.[58] High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom ASICs for molecular dynamics simulation. 
Vector processors
Main article: Vector processor
 The Cray-1 is a vector processor. 
A vector processor is a CPU or computer system that can execute the same instruction on large sets of data. Vector processors have high-level operations that work on linear arrays of numbers or vectors. An example vector operation is A = B × C, where A, B, and C are each 64-element vectors of 64-bit floating-point numbers.[64] They are closely related to Flynn's SIMD classification.[64] 
Cray computers became famous for their vector-processing computers in the 1970s and 1980s. However, vector processors—both as CPUs and as full computer systems—have generally disappeared. Modern processor instruction sets do include some vector processing instructions, such as with Freescale Semiconductor's AltiVec and Intel's Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). 
Software
Parallel programming languages
Main article: List of concurrent and parallel programming languages
Concurrent programming languages, libraries, APIs, and parallel programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) have been created for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP are two of the most widely used shared memory APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API.[65] One concept used in programming parallel programs is the future concept, where one part of a program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time. 
Efforts to standardize parallel programming include an open standard called OpenHMPP for hybrid multi-core parallel programming. The OpenHMPP directive-based programming model offers a syntax to efficiently offload computations on hardware accelerators and to optimize data movement to/from the hardware memory using remote procedure calls. 
The rise of consumer GPUs has led to support for compute kernels, either in graphics APIs (referred to as compute shaders), in dedicated APIs (such as OpenCL), or in other language extensions. 
Automatic parallelization
Main article: Automatic parallelization
Automatic parallelization of a sequential program by a compiler is the "holy grail" of parallel computing, especially with the aforementioned limit of processor frequency. Despite decades of work by compiler researchers, automatic parallelization has had only limited success.[66] 
Mainstream parallel programming languages remain either explicitly parallel or (at best) partially implicit, in which a programmer gives the compiler directives for parallelization. A few fully implicit parallel programming languages exist—SISAL, Parallel Haskell, SequenceL, System C (for FPGAs), Mitrion-C, VHDL, and Verilog. 
Application checkpointing
Main article: Application checkpointing
As a computer system grows in complexity, the mean time between failures usually decreases. Application checkpointing is a technique whereby the computer system takes a "snapshot" of the application—a record of all current resource allocations and variable states, akin to a core dump—; this information can be used to restore the program if the computer should fail. Application checkpointing means that the program has to restart from only its last checkpoint rather than the beginning. While checkpointing provides benefits in a variety of situations, it is especially useful in highly parallel systems with a large number of processors used in high performance computing.[67] 
Algorithmic methods
As parallel computers become larger and faster, we are now able to solve problems that had previously taken too long to run. Fields as varied as bioinformatics (for protein folding and sequence analysis) and economics have taken advantage of parallel computing. Common types of problems in parallel computing applications include:[68] 
	Dense linear algebra
	Sparse linear algebra
	Spectral methods (such as Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform)
	N-body problems (such as Barnes–Hut simulation)
	Structured grid problems (such as Lattice Boltzmann methods)
	Unstructured grid problems (such as found in finite element analysis)
	Monte Carlo method
	Combinational logic (such as brute-force cryptographic techniques)
	Graph traversal (such as sorting algorithms)
	Dynamic programming
	Branch and bound methods
	Graphical models (such as detecting hidden Markov models and constructing Bayesian networks)
	HBJ model, a concise message-passing model[69]
	Finite-state machine simulation
Fault tolerance
Further information: Fault-tolerant computer system
Parallel computing can also be applied to the design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component fails, and also allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These methods can be used to help prevent single-event upsets caused by transient errors.[70] Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost-effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems. 
History
For broader coverage of this topic, see History of computing.
 ILLIAC IV, "the most infamous of supercomputers"[71] 
The origins of true (MIMD) parallelism go back to Luigi Federico Menabrea and his Sketch of the Analytic Engine Invented by Charles Babbage.[72][73][74] 
In 1957, Compagnie des Machines Bull announced the first computer architecture specifically designed for parallelism, the Gamma 60.[75] It utilized a fork-join model and a "Program Distributor" to dispatch and collect data to and from independent processing units connected to a central memory.[76][77] 
In April 1958, Stanley Gill (Ferranti) discussed parallel programming and the need for branching and waiting.[78] Also in 1958, IBM researchers John Cocke and Daniel Slotnick discussed the use of parallelism in numerical calculations for the first time.[79] Burroughs Corporation introduced the D825 in 1962, a four-processor computer that accessed up to 16 memory modules through a crossbar switch.[80] In 1967, Amdahl and Slotnick published a debate about the feasibility of parallel processing at American Federation of Information Processing Societies Conference.[79] It was during this debate that Amdahl's law was coined to define the limit of speed-up due to parallelism. 
In 1969, Honeywell introduced its first Multics system, a symmetric multiprocessor system capable of running up to eight processors in parallel.[79] C.mmp, a multi-processor project at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1970s, was among the first multiprocessors with more than a few processors. The first bus-connected multiprocessor with snooping caches was the Synapse N+1 in 1984.[73] 
SIMD parallel computers can be traced back to the 1970s. The motivation behind early SIMD computers was to amortize the gate delay of the processor's control unit over multiple instructions.[81] In 1964, Slotnick had proposed building a massively parallel computer for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.[79] His design was funded by the US Air Force, which was the earliest SIMD parallel-computing effort, ILLIAC IV.[79] The key to its design was a fairly high parallelism, with up to 256 processors, which allowed the machine to work on large datasets in what would later be known as vector processing. However, ILLIAC IV was called "the most infamous of supercomputers", because the project was only one-fourth completed, but took 11 years and cost almost four times the original estimate.[71] When it was finally ready to run its first real application in 1976, it was outperformed by existing commercial supercomputers such as the Cray-1. 
Biological brain as massively parallel computer
In the early 1970s, at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert started developing the Society of Mind theory, which views the biological brain as massively parallel computer. In 1986, Minsky published The Society of Mind, which claims that "mind is formed from many little agents, each mindless by itself".[82] The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.[83] 
Similar models (which also view the biological brain as a massively parallel computer, i.e., the brain is made up of a constellation of independent or semi-independent agents) were also described by: 
	Thomas R. Blakeslee,[84]
	Michael S. Gazzaniga,[85][86]
	Robert E. Ornstein,[87]
	Ernest Hilgard,[88][89]
	Michio Kaku,[90]
	George Ivanovich Gurdjieff,[91]
	Neurocluster Brain Model.[92]

However, the holy grail of such research—automated parallelization of serial programs—has yet to materialize. While automated parallelization of certain classes of algorithms has been demonstrated, such success has largely been limited to scientific and numeric applications with predictable flow control (e.g., nested loop structures with statically determined iteration counts) and statically analyzable memory access patterns. (e.g., walks over large multidimensional arrays of float-point data).

 Block diagram of a basic computer with uniprocessor CPU. Black lines indicate control flow, whereas red lines indicate data flow. Arrows indicate the direction of flow. 
In computer science and computer engineering, computer architecture is a description of the structure of a computer system made from component parts.[1] It can sometimes be a high-level description that ignores details of the implementation.[2] At a more detailed level, the description may include the instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.[3] 
History
The first documented computer architecture was in the correspondence between Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, describing the analytical engine. While building the computer Z1 in 1936, Konrad Zuse described in two patent applications for his future projects that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data, i.e., the stored-program concept.[4][5] Two other early and important examples are: 
	John von Neumann's 1945 paper, First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, which described an organization of logical elements;[6] and
	Alan Turing's more detailed Proposed Electronic Calculator for the Automatic Computing Engine, also 1945 and which cited John von Neumann's paper.[7]
The term "architecture" in computer literature can be traced to the work of Lyle R. Johnson and Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., members of the Machine Organization department in IBM's main research center in 1959. Johnson had the opportunity to write a proprietary research communication about the Stretch, an IBM-developed supercomputer for Los Alamos National Laboratory (at the time known as Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory). To describe the level of detail for discussing the luxuriously embellished computer, he noted that his description of formats, instruction types, hardware parameters, and speed enhancements were at the level of "system architecture", a term that seemed more useful than "machine organization".[8] 
Subsequently, Brooks, a Stretch designer, opened Chapter 2 of a book called Planning a Computer System: Project Stretch by stating, "Computer architecture, like other architecture, is the art of determining the needs of the user of a structure and then designing to meet those needs as effectively as possible within economic and technological constraints."[9] 
Brooks went on to help develop the IBM System/360 line of computers, in which "architecture" became a noun defining "what the user needs to know".[10] The System/360 line was succeeded by several compatible lines of computers, including the current IBM Z line. Later, computer users came to use the term in many less explicit ways.[11] 
The earliest computer architectures were designed on paper and then directly built into the final hardware form.[12] Later, computer architecture prototypes were physically built in the form of a transistor–transistor logic (TTL) computer—such as the prototypes of the 6800 and the PA-RISC—tested, and tweaked, before committing to the final hardware form. As of the 1990s, new computer architectures are typically "built", tested, and tweaked—inside some other computer architecture in a computer architecture simulator; or inside a FPGA as a soft microprocessor; or both—before committing to the final hardware form.[13] 
Subcategories
The discipline of computer architecture has three main subcategories:[14] 
	Instruction set architecture (ISA): defines the machine code that a processor reads and acts upon as well as the word size, memory address modes, processor registers, and data type.
	Microarchitecture: also known as "computer organization", this describes how a particular processor will implement the ISA.[15] The size of a computer's CPU cache for instance, is an issue that generally has nothing to do with the ISA.
	Systems design: includes all of the other hardware components within a computing system, such as data processing other than the CPU (e.g., direct memory access), virtualization, and multiprocessing.
There are other technologies in computer architecture. The following technologies are used in bigger companies like Intel, and were estimated in 2002[14] to count for 1% of all of computer architecture: 
	Macroarchitecture: architectural layers more abstract than microarchitecture
	Assembly instruction set architecture: A smart assembler may convert an abstract assembly language common to a group of machines into slightly different machine language for different implementations.
	Programmer-visible macroarchitecture: higher-level language tools such as compilers may define a consistent interface or contract to programmers using them, abstracting differences between underlying ISAs and microarchitectures. For example, the C, C++, or Java standards define different programmer-visible macroarchitectures.
	Microcode: microcode is software that translates instructions to run on a chip. It acts like a wrapper around the hardware, presenting a preferred version of the hardware's instruction set interface. This instruction translation facility gives chip designers flexible options: E.g. 1. A new improved version of the chip can use microcode to present the exact same instruction set as the old chip version, so all software targeting that instruction set will run on the new chip without needing changes. E.g. 2. Microcode can present a variety of instruction sets for the same underlying chip, allowing it to run a wider variety of software.
	Pin architecture: The hardware functions that a microprocessor should provide to a hardware platform, e.g., the x86 pins A20M, FERR/IGNNE or FLUSH. Also, messages that the processor should emit so that external caches can be invalidated (emptied). Pin architecture functions are more flexible than ISA functions because external hardware can adapt to new encodings, or change from a pin to a message. The term "architecture" fits, because the functions must be provided for compatible systems, even if the detailed method changes.
Roles
Definition
Computer architecture is concerned with balancing the performance, efficiency, cost, and reliability of a computer system. The case of instruction set architecture can be used to illustrate the balance of these competing factors. More complex instruction sets enable programmers to write more space efficient programs, since a single instruction can encode some higher-level abstraction (such as the x86 Loop instruction).[16] However, longer and more complex instructions take longer for the processor to decode and can be more costly to implement effectively. The increased complexity from a large instruction set also creates more room for unreliability when instructions interact in unexpected ways. 
The implementation involves integrated circuit design, packaging, power, and cooling. Optimization of the design requires familiarity with topics from compilers and operating systems to logic design and packaging.[17] 
Instruction set architecture

An instruction set architecture (ISA) is the interface between the computer's software and hardware and also can be viewed as the programmer's view of the machine. Computers do not understand high-level programming languages such as Java, C++, or most programming languages used. A processor only understands instructions encoded in some numerical fashion, usually as binary numbers. Software tools, such as compilers, translate those high level languages into instructions that the processor can understand. 
Besides instructions, the ISA defines items in the computer that are available to a program—e.g., data types, registers, addressing modes, and memory. Instructions locate these available items with register indexes (or names) and memory addressing modes. 
The ISA of a computer is usually described in a small instruction manual, which describes how the instructions are encoded. Also, it may define short (vaguely) mnemonic names for the instructions. The names can be recognized by a software development tool called an assembler. An assembler is a computer program that translates a human-readable form of the ISA into a computer-readable form. Disassemblers are also widely available, usually in debuggers and software programs to isolate and correct malfunctions in binary computer programs. 
ISAs vary in quality and completeness. A good ISA compromises between programmer convenience (how easy the code is to understand), size of the code (how much code is required to do a specific action), cost of the computer to interpret the instructions (more complexity means more hardware needed to decode and execute the instructions), and speed of the computer (with more complex decoding hardware comes longer decode time). Memory organization defines how instructions interact with the memory, and how memory interacts with itself. 
During design emulation, emulators can run programs written in a proposed instruction set. Modern emulators can measure size, cost, and speed to determine whether a particular ISA is meeting its goals. 
Computer organization
Main article: Microarchitecture
Computer organization helps optimize performance-based products. For example, software engineers need to know the processing power of processors. They may need to optimize software in order to gain the most performance for the lowest price. This can require quite a detailed analysis of the computer's organization. For example, in an SD card, the designers might need to arrange the card so that the most data can be processed in the fastest possible way. 
Computer organization also helps plan the selection of a processor for a particular project. Multimedia projects may need very rapid data access, while virtual machines may need fast interrupts. Sometimes certain tasks need additional components as well. For example, a computer capable of running a virtual machine needs virtual memory hardware so that the memory of different virtual computers can be kept separated. Computer organization and features also affect power consumption and processor cost. 
Implementation
Once an instruction set and microarchitecture have been designed, a practical machine must be developed. This design process is called the implementation. Implementation is usually not considered architectural design, but rather hardware design engineering. Implementation can be further broken down into several steps: 
	Logic implementation designs the circuits required at a logic-gate level.
	Circuit implementation does transistor-level designs of basic elements (e.g., gates, multiplexers, latches) as well as of some larger blocks (ALUs, caches etc.) that may be implemented at the logic-gate level, or even at the physical level if the design calls for it.
	Physical implementation draws physical circuits. The different circuit components are placed in a chip floor plan or on a board and the wires connecting them are created.
	Design validation tests the computer as a whole to see if it works in all situations and all timings. Once the design validation process starts, the design at the logic level are tested using logic emulators. However, this is usually too slow to run a realistic test. So, after making corrections based on the first test, prototypes are constructed using Field-Programmable Gate-Arrays (FPGAs). Most hobby projects stop at this stage. The final step is to test prototype integrated circuits, which may require several redesigns.
For CPUs, the entire implementation process is organized differently and is often referred to as CPU design. 
Design goals
The exact form of a computer system depends on the constraints and goals. Computer architectures usually trade off standards, power versus performance, cost, memory capacity, latency (latency is the amount of time that it takes for information from one node to travel to the source) and throughput. Sometimes other considerations, such as features, size, weight, reliability, and expandability are also factors. 
The most common scheme does an in-depth power analysis and figures out how to keep power consumption low while maintaining adequate performance. 
Performance
Modern computer performance is often described in instructions per cycle (IPC), which measures the efficiency of the architecture at any clock frequency; a faster IPC rate means the computer is faster. Older computers had IPC counts as low as 0.1 while modern processors easily reach nearly 1. Superscalar processors may reach three to five IPC by executing several instructions per clock cycle.[citation needed] 
Counting machine-language instructions would be misleading because they can do varying amounts of work in different ISAs. The "instruction" in the standard measurements is not a count of the ISA's machine-language instructions, but a unit of measurement, usually based on the speed of the VAX computer architecture. 
Many people used to measure a computer's speed by the clock rate (usually in MHz or GHz). This refers to the cycles per second of the main clock of the CPU. However, this metric is somewhat misleading, as a machine with a higher clock rate may not necessarily have greater performance. As a result, manufacturers have moved away from clock speed as a measure of performance. 
Other factors influence speed, such as the mix of functional units, bus speeds, available memory, and the type and order of instructions in the programs. 
There are two main types of speed: latency and throughput. Latency is the time between the start of a process and its completion. Throughput is the amount of work done per unit time. Interrupt latency is the guaranteed maximum response time of the system to an electronic event (like when the disk drive finishes moving some data). 
Performance is affected by a very wide range of design choices — for example, pipelining a processor usually makes latency worse, but makes throughput better. Computers that control machinery usually need low interrupt latencies. These computers operate in a real-time environment and fail if an operation is not completed in a specified amount of time. For example, computer-controlled anti-lock brakes must begin braking within a predictable and limited time period after the brake pedal is sensed or else failure of the brake will occur. 
Benchmarking takes all these factors into account by measuring the time a computer takes to run through a series of test programs. Although benchmarking shows strengths, it should not be how you choose a computer. Often the measured machines split on different measures. For example, one system might handle scientific applications quickly, while another might render video games more smoothly. Furthermore, designers may target and add special features to their products, through hardware or software, that permit a specific benchmark to execute quickly but do not offer similar advantages to general tasks.

Performance is affected by a very wide range of design choices — for example, pipelining a processor usually makes latency worse, but makes throughput better. Computers that control machinery usually need low interrupt latencies. These computers operate in a real-time environment and fail if an operation is not completed in a specified amount of time. For example, computer-controlled anti-lock brakes must begin braking within a predictable and limited time period after the brake pedal is sensed or else failure of the brake will occur. 
Benchmarking takes all these factors into account by measuring the time a computer takes to run through a series of test programs. Although benchmarking shows strengths, it should not be how you choose a computer. Often the measured machines split on different measures. For example, one system might handle scientific applications quickly, while another might render video games more smoothly. Furthermore, designers may target and add special features to their products, through hardware or software, that permit a specific benchmark to execute quickly but do not offer similar advantages to general tasks. 
Power efficiency
Main articles: Low-power electronics and Performance per watt
Power efficiency is another important measurement in modern computers. Higher power efficiency can often be traded for lower speed or higher cost. The typical measurement when referring to power consumption in computer architecture is MIPS/W (millions of instructions per second per watt). 
Modern circuits have less power required per transistor as the number of transistors per chip grows.[18] This is because each transistor that is put in a new chip requires its own power supply and requires new pathways to be built to power it. However, the number of transistors per chip is starting to increase at a slower rate. Therefore, power efficiency is starting to become as important, if not more important than fitting more and more transistors into a single chip. Recent processor designs have shown this emphasis as they put more focus on power efficiency rather than cramming as many transistors into a single chip as possible.[19] In the world of embedded computers, power efficiency has long been an important goal next to throughput and latency. 
Shifts in market demand
Increases in clock frequency have grown more slowly over the past few years, compared to power reduction improvements. This has been driven by the end of Moore's Law and demand for longer battery life and reductions in size for mobile technology. This change in focus from higher clock rates to power consumption and miniaturization can be shown by the significant reductions in power consumption, as much as 50%, that were reported by Intel in their release of the Haswell microarchitecture; where they dropped their power consumption benchmark from 30–40 watts down to 10–20 watts.[20] Comparing this to the processing speed increase of 3 GHz to 4 GHz (2002 to 2006), it can be seen that the focus in research and development is shifting away from clock frequency and moving towards consuming less power and taking up less space.[21]

In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EMR) consists of waves of the electromagnetic (EM) field, which propagate through space and carry momentum and electromagnetic radiant energy.[1][2] 
Classically, electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields. In a vacuum, electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light, commonly denoted c. There, depending on the frequency of oscillation, different wavelengths of electromagnetic spectrum are produced. In homogeneous, isotropic media, the oscillations of the two fields are on average perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a transverse wave. 
Electromagnetic radiation is commonly referred to as "light", EM, EMR, or electromagnetic waves.[2] 
The position of an electromagnetic wave within the electromagnetic spectrum can be characterized by either its frequency of oscillation or its wavelength. Electromagnetic waves of different frequency are called by different names since they have different sources and effects on matter. In order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength, the electromagnetic spectrum includes: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.[3][4] 
Electromagnetic waves are emitted by electrically charged particles undergoing acceleration,[5][6] and these waves can subsequently interact with other charged particles, exerting force on them. EM waves carry energy, momentum, and angular momentum away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact. Electromagnetic radiation is associated with those EM waves that are free to propagate themselves ("radiate") without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them, because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges. Thus, EMR is sometimes referred to as the far field, while the near field refers to EM fields near the charges and current that directly produced them, specifically electromagnetic induction and electrostatic induction phenomena. 
In quantum mechanics, an alternate way of viewing EMR is that it consists of photons, uncharged elementary particles with zero rest mass which are the quanta of the electromagnetic field, responsible for all electromagnetic interactions.[7] Quantum electrodynamics is the theory of how EMR interacts with matter on an atomic level.[8] Quantum effects provide additional sources of EMR, such as the transition of electrons to lower energy levels in an atom and black-body radiation.[9] The energy of an individual photon is quantized and proportional to frequency according to Planck's equation E = hf, where E is the energy per photon, f is the frequency of the photon, and h is the Planck constant. Thus, higher frequency photons have more energy. For example, a 1020 Hz gamma ray photon has 1019 times the energy of a 101 Hz extremely low frequency radio wave photon. 
The effects of EMR upon chemical compounds and biological organisms depend both upon the radiation's power and its frequency. EMR of lower energy ultraviolet or lower frequencies (i.e., near ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves) is non-ionizing because its photons do not individually have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules or to break chemical bonds. The effect of non-ionizing radiation on chemical systems and living tissue is primarily simply heating, through the combined energy transfer of many photons. In contrast, high frequency ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays are ionizing – individual photons of such high frequency have enough energy to ionize molecules or break chemical bonds. Ionizing radiation can cause chemical reactions and damage living cells beyond simply heating, and can be a health hazard and dangerous.

Maxwell's equations
James Clerk Maxwell derived a wave form of the electric and magnetic equations, thus uncovering the wave-like nature of electric and magnetic fields and their symmetry. Because the speed of EM waves predicted by the wave equation coincided with the measured speed of light, Maxwell concluded that light itself is an EM wave.[10][11] Maxwell's equations were confirmed by Heinrich Hertz through experiments with radio waves.[12] 
Near and far fields
Main articles: Near and far field and Liénard–Wiechert potential
 In electromagnetic radiation (such as microwaves from an antenna, shown here) the term radiation applies only to the parts of the electromagnetic field that radiate into infinite space and decrease in intensity by an inverse-square law of power, such that the total energy that crosses through an imaginary sphere surrounding the source is the same regardless of the size of the sphere. Electromagnetic radiation thus reaches the far part of the electromagnetic field around a transmitter. A part of the near field (close to the transmitter) includes the changing electromagnetic field, but that is not electromagnetic radiation. 
Maxwell's equations established that some charges and currents (sources) produce local electromagnetic fields near them that do not radiate. Currents directly produce magnetic fields, but such fields of a magnetic-dipole–type that dies out with distance from the current. In a similar manner, moving charges pushed apart in a conductor by a changing electrical potential (such as in an antenna) produce an electric-dipole–type electrical field, but this also declines with distance. These fields make up the near field. Neither of these behaviours is responsible for EM radiation. Instead, they only efficiently transfer energy to a receiver very close to the source, such as inside a transformer. The near field has strong effects its source, with any energy withdrawn by a receiver causing increased load (decreased electrical reactance) on the source. The near field does not propagate freely into space, carrying energy away without a distance limit, but rather oscillates, returning its energy to the transmitter if it is not absorbed by a receiver.[13] 
By contrast, the far field is composed of radiation that is free of the transmitter, in the sense that the transmitter requires the same power to send changes in the field out regardless of whether anything absorbs the signal, e.g. a radio station does not need to increase its power when more receivers use the signal. This far part of the electromagnetic field is electromagnetic radiation. The far fields propagate (radiate) without allowing the transmitter to affect them. This causes them to be independent in the sense that their existence and their energy, after they have left the transmitter, is completely independent of both transmitter and receiver. Due to conservation of energy, the amount of power passing through any spherical surface drawn around the source is the same. Because such a surface has an area proportional to the square of its distance from the source, the power density of EM radiation from an isotropic source decreases with the inverse square of the distance from the source; this is called the inverse-square law. This is in contrast to dipole parts of the EM field, the near field, which varies in intensity according to an inverse cube power law, and thus does not transport a conserved amount of energy over distances but instead fades with distance, with its energy (as noted) rapidly returning to the transmitter or absorbed by a nearby receiver (such as a transformer secondary coil). 
In the Liénard–Wiechert potential formulation of the electric and magnetic fields due to motion of a single particle (according to Maxwell's equations), the terms associated with acceleration of the particle are those that are responsible for the part of the field that is regarded as electromagnetic radiation. By contrast, the term associated with the changing static electric field of the particle and the magnetic term that results from the particle's uniform velocity are both associated with the near field, and do not comprise electromagnetic radiation.[14] 
Properties
 Electromagnetic waves can be imagined as a self-propagating transverse oscillating wave of electric and magnetic fields. This 3D animation shows a plane linearly polarized wave propagating from left to right. The electric and magnetic fields in such a wave are in-phase with each other, reaching minima and maxima together. 
Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of superposition. Thus, a field due to any particular particle or time-varying electric or magnetic field contributes to the fields present in the same space due to other causes. Further, as they are vector fields, all magnetic and electric field vectors add together according to vector addition.[15] For example, in optics two or more coherent light waves may interact and by constructive or destructive interference yield a resultant irradiance deviating from the sum of the component irradiances of the individual light waves.[16] 
The electromagnetic fields of light are not affected by traveling through static electric or magnetic fields in a linear medium such as a vacuum. However, in nonlinear media, such as some crystals, interactions can occur between light and static electric and magnetic fields—these interactions include the Faraday effect and the Kerr effect.[17][18] 
In refraction, a wave crossing from one medium to another of different density alters its speed and direction upon entering the new medium. The ratio of the refractive indices of the media determines the degree of refraction, and is summarized by Snell's law. Light of composite wavelengths (natural sunlight) disperses into a visible spectrum passing through a prism, because of the wavelength-dependent refractive index of the prism material (dispersion); that is, each component wave within the composite light is bent a different amount.[19] 
EM radiation exhibits both wave properties and particle properties at the same time (see wave-particle duality). Both wave and particle characteristics have been confirmed in many experiments. Wave characteristics are more apparent when EM radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and distances. For example, when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by matter, particle-like properties will be more obvious when the average number of photons in the cube of the relevant wavelength is much smaller than 1. It is not so difficult to experimentally observe non-uniform deposition of energy when light is absorbed, however this alone is not evidence of "particulate" behavior. Rather, it reflects the quantum nature of matter.[20] Demonstrating that the light itself is quantized, not merely its interaction with matter, is a more subtle affair. 
Some experiments display both the wave and particle natures of electromagnetic waves, such as the self-interference of a single photon.[21] When a single photon is sent through an interferometer, it passes through both paths, interfering with itself, as waves do, yet is detected by a photomultiplier or other sensitive detector only once. 
A quantum theory of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter such as electrons is described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics. 
Electromagnetic waves can be polarized, reflected, refracted, or diffracted, and can interfere with each other.[22][23][24] 
Wave model
 Representation of the electric field vector of a wave of circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation
In homogeneous, isotropic media, electromagnetic radiation is a transverse wave,[25] meaning that its oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer and travel. It comes from the following equations: These equations predicate that any electromagnetic wave must be a transverse wave, where the electric field E and the magnetic field B are both perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. 
The electric and magnetic parts of the field in an electromagnetic wave stand in a fixed ratio of strengths to satisfy the two Maxwell equations that specify how one is produced from the other. In dissipation-less (lossless) media, these E and B fields are also in phase, with both reaching maxima and minima at the same points in space (see illustrations). In the far-field EM radiation which is described by the two source-free Maxwell curl operator equations, a time-change in one type of field is proportional to the curl of the other. These derivatives require that the E and B fields in EMR are in-phase (see mathematics section below).[citation needed] An important aspect of light's nature is its frequency. The frequency of a wave is its rate of oscillation and is measured in hertz, the SI unit of frequency, where one hertz is equal to one oscillation per second. Light usually has multiple frequencies that sum to form the resultant wave. Different frequencies undergo different angles of refraction, a phenomenon known as dispersion. 
A monochromatic wave (a wave of a single frequency) consists of successive troughs and crests, and the distance between two adjacent crests or troughs is called the wavelength. Waves of the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size, from very long radio waves longer than a continent to very short gamma rays smaller than atom nuclei. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, according to the equation:[26] 
 
where v is the speed of the wave (c in a vacuum or less in other media), f is the frequency and λ is the wavelength. As waves cross boundaries between different media, their speeds change but their frequencies remain constant. 
Electromagnetic waves in free space must be solutions of Maxwell's electromagnetic wave equation. Two main classes of solutions are known, namely plane waves and spherical waves. The plane waves may be viewed as the limiting case of spherical waves at a very large (ideally infinite) distance from the source. Both types of waves can have a waveform which is an arbitrary time function (so long as it is sufficiently differentiable to conform to the wave equation). As with any time function, this can be decomposed by means of Fourier analysis into its frequency spectrum, or individual sinusoidal components, each of which contains a single frequency, amplitude and phase. Such a component wave is said to be monochromatic. A monochromatic electromagnetic wave can be characterized by its frequency or wavelength, its peak amplitude, its phase relative to some reference phase, its direction of propagation, and its polarization. 
Interference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern. If the fields have components in the same direction, they constructively interfere, while opposite directions cause destructive interference. Additionally, multiple polarization signals can be combined (i.e. interfered) to form new states of polarization, which is known as parallel polarization state generation.[27] 
The energy in electromagnetic waves is sometimes called radiant energy.[28][29][30] 
Particle model and quantum theory
See also: Quantization (physics) and Quantum optics
An anomaly arose in the late 19th century involving a contradiction between the wave theory of light and measurements of the electromagnetic spectra that were being emitted by thermal radiators known as black bodies. Physicists struggled with this problem unsuccessfully for many years, and it later became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe. In 1900, Max Planck developed a new theory of black-body radiation that explained the observed spectrum. Planck's theory was based on the idea that black bodies emit light (and other electromagnetic radiation) only as discrete bundles or packets of energy. These packets were called quanta. In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed that light quanta be regarded as real particles. Later the particle of light was given the name photon, to correspond with other particles being described around this time, such as the electron and proton. A photon has an energy, E, proportional to its frequency, f, by 
 
where h is the Planck constant,  is the wavelength and c is the speed of light. This is sometimes known as the Planck–Einstein equation.[31] In quantum theory (see first quantization) the energy of the photons is thus directly proportional to the frequency of the EMR wave.[32] 
Likewise, the momentum p of a photon is also proportional to its frequency and inversely proportional to its wavelength: 
 
The source of Einstein's proposal that light was composed of particles (or could act as particles in some circumstances) was an experimental anomaly not explained by the wave theory: the photoelectric effect, in which light striking a metal surface ejected electrons from the surface, causing an electric current to flow across an applied voltage. Experimental measurements demonstrated that the energy of individual ejected electrons was proportional to the frequency, rather than the intensity, of the light. Furthermore, below a certain minimum frequency, which depended on the particular metal, no current would flow regardless of the intensity. These observations appeared to contradict the wave theory, and for years physicists tried in vain to find an explanation. In 1905, Einstein explained this puzzle by resurrecting the particle theory of light to explain the observed effect. Because of the preponderance of evidence in favor of the wave theory, however, Einstein's ideas were met initially with great skepticism among established physicists. Eventually Einstein's explanation was accepted as new particle-like behavior of light was observed, such as the Compton effect.[33][34] 
As a photon is absorbed by an atom, it excites the atom, elevating an electron to a higher energy level (one that is on average farther from the nucleus). When an electron in an excited molecule or atom descends to a lower energy level, it emits a photon of light at a frequency corresponding to the energy difference. Since the energy levels of electrons in atoms are discrete, each element and each molecule emits and absorbs its own characteristic frequencies. Immediate photon emission is called fluorescence, a type of photoluminescence. An example is visible light emitted from fluorescent paints, in response to ultraviolet (blacklight). Many other fluorescent emissions are known in spectral bands other than visible light. Delayed emission is called phosphorescence.[35][36] 
Wave–particle duality
Main article: Wave–particle duality
The modern theory that explains the nature of light includes the notion of wave–particle duality. 
Wave and particle effects of electromagnetic radiation
Together, wave and particle effects fully explain the emission and absorption spectra of EM radiation. The matter-composition of the medium through which the light travels determines the nature of the absorption and emission spectrum. These bands correspond to the allowed energy levels in the atoms. Dark bands in the absorption spectrum are due to the atoms in an intervening medium between source and observer. The atoms absorb certain frequencies of the light between emitter and detector/eye, then emit them in all directions. A dark band appears to the detector, due to the radiation scattered out of the light beam. For instance, dark bands in the light emitted by a distant star are due to the atoms in the star's atmosphere. A similar phenomenon occurs for emission, which is seen when an emitting gas glows due to excitation of the atoms from any mechanism, including heat. As electrons descend to lower energy levels, a spectrum is emitted that represents the jumps between the energy levels of the electrons, but lines are seen because again emission happens only at particular energies after excitation.[37] An example is the emission spectrum of nebulae.[38] Rapidly moving electrons are most sharply accelerated when they encounter a region of force, so they are responsible for producing much of the highest frequency electromagnetic radiation observed in nature. 
These phenomena can aid various chemical determinations for the composition of gases lit from behind (absorption spectra) and for glowing gases (emission spectra). Spectroscopy (for example) determines what chemical elements comprise a particular star. Spectroscopy is also used in the determination of the distance of a star, using the red shift.[39] 
Propagation speed
Main article: Speed of light
When any wire (or other conducting object such as an antenna) conducts alternating current, electromagnetic radiation is propagated at the same frequency as the current. 
As a wave, light is characterized by a velocity (the speed of light), wavelength, and frequency. As particles, light is a stream of photons. Each has an energy related to the frequency of the wave given by Planck's relation E = hf, where E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck constant, 6.626 × 10−34 J•s, and f is the frequency of the wave.[40] 
In a medium (other than vacuum), velocity factor or refractive index are considered, depending on frequency and application. Both of these are ratios of the speed in a medium to speed in a vacuum. 
History of discovery
See also: History of electromagnetic theory, Timeline of electromagnetism and classical optics, and Radiation § Discovery
Electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths other than those of visible light were discovered in the early 19th century. The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to astronomer William Herschel, who published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London.[41] Herschel used a glass prism to refract light from the Sun and detected invisible rays that caused heating beyond the red part of the spectrum, through an increase in the temperature recorded with a thermometer. These "calorific rays" were later termed infrared.[42] 
In 1801, German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter discovered ultraviolet in an experiment similar to Herschel's, using sunlight and a glass prism. Ritter noted that invisible rays near the violet edge of a solar spectrum dispersed by a triangular prism darkened silver chloride preparations more quickly than did the nearby violet light. Ritter's experiments were an early precursor to what would become photography. Ritter noted that the ultraviolet rays (which at first were called "chemical rays") were capable of causing chemical reactions.[43][44] 
 James Clerk Maxwell 
(1831–1879) 
In 1862–64 James Clerk Maxwell developed equations for the electromagnetic field which suggested that waves in the field would travel with a speed that was very close to the known speed of light. Maxwell therefore suggested that visible light (as well as invisible infrared and ultraviolet rays by inference) all consisted of propagating disturbances (or radiation) in the electromagnetic field. Radio waves were first produced deliberately by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, using electrical circuits calculated to produce oscillations at a much lower frequency than that of visible light, following recipes for producing oscillating charges and currents suggested by Maxwell's equations. Hertz also developed ways to detect these waves, and produced and characterized what were later termed radio waves and microwaves.[45]: 286, 7  
Wilhelm Röntgen discovered and named X-rays. After experimenting with high voltages applied to an evacuated tube on 8 November 1895, he noticed a fluorescence on a nearby plate of coated glass. In one month, he discovered X-rays' main properties.[45]: 307  
The last portion of the EM spectrum to be discovered was associated with radioactivity. Henri Becquerel found that uranium salts caused fogging of an unexposed photographic plate through a covering paper in a manner similar to X-rays, and Marie Curie discovered that only certain elements gave off these rays of energy, soon discovering the intense radiation of radium. The radiation from pitchblende was differentiated into alpha rays (alpha particles) and beta rays (beta particles) by Ernest Rutherford through simple experimentation in 1899, but these proved to be charged particulate types of radiation. However, in 1900 the French scientist Paul Villard discovered a third neutrally charged and especially penetrating type of radiation from radium, and after he described it, Rutherford realized it must be yet a third type of radiation, which in 1903 Rutherford named gamma rays. In 1910 British physicist William Henry Bragg demonstrated that gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, not particles, and in 1914 Rutherford and Edward Andrade measured their wavelengths, finding that they were similar to X-rays but with shorter wavelengths and higher frequency, although a 'cross-over' between X and gamma rays makes it possible to have X-rays with a higher energy (and hence shorter wavelength) than gamma rays and vice versa. The origin of the ray differentiates them, gamma rays tend to be natural phenomena originating from the unstable nucleus of an atom and X-rays are electrically generated (and hence man-made) unless they are as a result of bremsstrahlung X-radiation caused by the interaction of fast moving particles (such as beta particles) colliding with certain materials, usually of higher atomic numbers.[45]: 308, 9

EM radiation (the designation 'radiation' excludes static electric and magnetic and near fields) is classified by wavelength into radio, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. Arbitrary electromagnetic waves can be expressed by Fourier analysis in terms of sinusoidal waves (monochromatic radiation), which in turn can each be classified into these regions of the EMR spectrum. 
For certain classes of EM waves, the waveform is most usefully treated as random, and then spectral analysis must be done by slightly different mathematical techniques appropriate to random or stochastic processes. In such cases, the individual frequency components are represented in terms of their power content, and the phase information is not preserved. Such a representation is called the power spectral density of the random process. Random electromagnetic radiation requiring this kind of analysis is, for example, encountered in the interior of stars, and in certain other very wideband forms of radiation such as the Zero point wave field of the electromagnetic vacuum. 
The behavior of EM radiation and its interaction with matter depends on its frequency, and changes qualitatively as the frequency changes. Lower frequencies have longer wavelengths, and higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and are associated with photons of higher energy. There is no fundamental limit known to these wavelengths or energies, at either end of the spectrum, although photons with energies near the Planck energy or exceeding it (far too high to have ever been observed) will require new physical theories to describe. 
Radio and microwave
Main articles: Radio wave and Microwave
When radio waves impinge upon a conductor, they couple to the conductor, travel along it and induce an electric current on the conductor surface by moving the electrons of the conducting material in correlated bunches of charge. 
Electromagnetic radiation phenomena with wavelengths ranging from as long as one meter to as short as one millimeter are called microwaves; with frequencies between 300 MHz (0.3 GHz) and 300 GHz. 
At radio and microwave frequencies, EMR interacts with matter largely as a bulk collection of charges which are spread out over large numbers of affected atoms. In electrical conductors, such induced bulk movement of charges (electric currents) results in absorption of the EMR, or else separations of charges that cause generation of new EMR (effective reflection of the EMR). An example is absorption or emission of radio waves by antennas, or absorption of microwaves by water or other molecules with an electric dipole moment, as for example inside a microwave oven. These interactions produce either electric currents or heat, or both. 
Infrared
Main article: Infrared
Like radio and microwave, infrared (IR) also is reflected by metals (and also most EMR, well into the ultraviolet range). However, unlike lower-frequency radio and microwave radiation, Infrared EMR commonly interacts with dipoles present in single molecules, which change as atoms vibrate at the ends of a single chemical bond. It is consequently absorbed by a wide range of substances, causing them to increase in temperature as the vibrations dissipate as heat. The same process, run in reverse, causes bulk substances to radiate in the infrared spontaneously (see thermal radiation section below). 
Infrared radiation is divided into spectral subregions. While different subdivision schemes exist,[46][47] the spectrum is commonly divided as near-infrared (0.75–1.4 μm), short-wavelength infrared (1.4–3 μm), mid-wavelength infrared (3–8 μm), long-wavelength infrared (8–15 μm) and far infrared (15–1000 μm).[48] 
Visible light
Main article: Light
Natural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum. EM radiation with a wavelength between approximately 400 nm and 700 nm is directly detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Other wavelengths, especially nearby infrared (longer than 700 nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 400 nm) are also sometimes referred to as light. 
As frequency increases into the visible range, photons have enough energy to change the bond structure of some individual molecules. It is not a coincidence that this happens in the visible range, as the mechanism of vision involves the change in bonding of a single molecule, retinal, which absorbs a single photon. The change in retinal causes a change in the shape of the rhodopsin protein it is contained in, which starts the biochemical process that causes the retina of the human eye to sense the light. 
Photosynthesis becomes possible in this range as well, for the same reason. A single molecule of chlorophyll is excited by a single photon. In plant tissues that conduct photosynthesis, carotenoids act to quench electronically excited chlorophyll produced by visible light in a process called non-photochemical quenching, to prevent reactions that would otherwise interfere with photosynthesis at high light levels. 
Animals that detect infrared make use of small packets of water that change temperature, in an essentially thermal process that involves many photons. 
Infrared, microwaves and radio waves are known to damage molecules and biological tissue only by bulk heating, not excitation from single photons of the radiation. 
Visible light is able to affect only a tiny percentage of all molecules. Usually not in a permanent or damaging way, rather the photon excites an electron which then emits another photon when returning to its original position. This is the source of color produced by most dyes. Retinal is an exception. When a photon is absorbed, the retinal permanently changes structure from cis to trans, and requires a protein to convert it back, i.e. reset it to be able to function as a light detector again. 
Limited evidence indicate that some reactive oxygen species are created by visible light in skin, and that these may have some role in photoaging, in the same manner as ultraviolet A.[49] 
Ultraviolet
Main article: Ultraviolet
As frequency increases into the ultraviolet, photons now carry enough energy (about three electron volts or more) to excite certain doubly bonded molecules into permanent chemical rearrangement. In DNA, this causes lasting damage. DNA is also indirectly damaged by reactive oxygen species produced by ultraviolet A (UVA), which has energy too low to damage DNA directly. This is why ultraviolet at all wavelengths can damage DNA, and is capable of causing cancer, and (for UVB) skin burns (sunburn) that are far worse than would be produced by simple heating (temperature increase) effects. 
At the higher end of the ultraviolet range, the energy of photons becomes large enough to impart enough energy to electrons to cause them to be liberated from the atom, in a process called photoionisation. The energy required for this is always larger than about 10 electron volt (eV) corresponding with wavelengths smaller than 124 nm (some sources suggest a more realistic cutoff of 33 eV, which is the energy required to ionize water). This high end of the ultraviolet spectrum with energies in the approximate ionization range, is sometimes called "extreme UV". Ionizing UV is strongly filtered by the Earth's atmosphere.[citation needed] 
X-rays and gamma rays
Main articles: X-rays and Gamma rays
Electromagnetic radiation composed of photons that carry minimum-ionization energy, or more, (which includes the entire spectrum with shorter wavelengths), is therefore termed ionizing radiation. (Many other kinds of ionizing radiation are made of non-EM particles). Electromagnetic-type ionizing radiation extends from the extreme ultraviolet to all higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths, which means that all X-rays and gamma rays qualify. These are capable of the most severe types of molecular damage, which can happen in biology to any type of biomolecule, including mutation and cancer, and often at great depths below the skin, since the higher end of the X-ray spectrum, and all of the gamma ray spectrum, penetrate matter.[citation needed] 
Atmosphere and magnetosphere
Main articles: ozone layer, shortwave radio, skywave, ionosphere, atmospheric window, and optical window
 Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric absorption and scattering (or opacity) of various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation 
Most UV and X-rays are blocked by absorption first from molecular nitrogen, and then (for wavelengths in the upper UV) from the electronic excitation of dioxygen and finally ozone at the mid-range of UV. Only 30% of the Sun's ultraviolet light reaches the ground, and almost all of this is well transmitted. 
Visible light is well transmitted in air, a property known as an atmospheric window, as it is not energetic enough to excite nitrogen, oxygen, or ozone, but too energetic to excite molecular vibrational frequencies of water vapor and CO2.[50] 
Absorption bands in the infrared are due to modes of vibrational excitation in water vapor. However, at energies too low to excite water vapor, the atmosphere becomes transparent again, allowing free transmission of most microwave and radio waves. [51] 
Finally, at radio wavelengths longer than 10 m or so (about 30 MHz), the air in the lower atmosphere remains transparent to radio, but plasma in certain layers of the ionosphere begins to interact with radio waves (see skywave). This property allows some longer wavelengths (100 m or 3 MHz) to be reflected and results in shortwave radio beyond line-of-sight. However, certain ionospheric effects begin to block incoming radiowaves from space, when their frequency is less than about 10 MHz (wavelength longer than about 30 m).[52] 
Thermal and electromagnetic radiation as a form of heat
Main articles: Thermal radiation and Planck's law
The basic structure of matter involves charged particles bound together. When electromagnetic radiation impinges on matter, it causes the charged particles to oscillate and gain energy. The ultimate fate of this energy depends on the context. It could be immediately re-radiated and appear as scattered, reflected, or transmitted radiation. It may get dissipated into other microscopic motions within the matter, coming to thermal equilibrium and manifesting itself as thermal energy, or even kinetic energy, in the material. With a few exceptions related to high-energy photons (such as fluorescence, harmonic generation, photochemical reactions, the photovoltaic effect for ionizing radiations at far ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma radiation), absorbed electromagnetic radiation simply deposits its energy by heating the material. This happens for infrared, microwave and radio wave radiation. Intense radio waves can thermally burn living tissue and can cook food. In addition to infrared lasers, sufficiently intense visible and ultraviolet lasers can easily set paper afire.[53] 
Ionizing radiation creates high-speed electrons in a material and breaks chemical bonds, but after these electrons collide many times with other atoms eventually most of the energy becomes thermal energy all in a tiny fraction of a second. This process makes ionizing radiation far more dangerous per unit of energy than non-ionizing radiation. This caveat also applies to UV, even though almost all of it is not ionizing, because UV can damage molecules due to electronic excitation, which is far greater per unit energy than heating effects.[53][citation needed] 
Infrared radiation in the spectral distribution of a black body is usually considered a form of heat, since it has an equivalent temperature and is associated with an entropy change per unit of thermal energy. However, "heat" is a technical term in physics and thermodynamics and is often confused with thermal energy. Any type of electromagnetic energy can be transformed into thermal energy in interaction with matter. Thus, any electromagnetic radiation can "heat" (in the sense of increase the thermal energy temperature of) a material, when it is absorbed.[54] 
The inverse or time-reversed process of absorption is thermal radiation. Much of the thermal energy in matter consists of random motion of charged particles, and this energy can be radiated away from the matter. The resulting radiation may subsequently be absorbed by another piece of matter, with the deposited energy heating the material.[55] 
The electromagnetic radiation in an opaque cavity at thermal equilibrium is effectively a form of thermal energy, having maximum radiation entropy.[56] 
Biological effects
Main articles: Electromagnetic radiation and health and Wireless device radiation and health
Bioelectromagnetics is the study of the interactions and effects of EM radiation on living organisms. The effects of electromagnetic radiation upon living cells, including those in humans, depends upon the radiation's power and frequency. For low-frequency radiation (radio waves to near ultraviolet) the best-understood effects are those due to radiation power alone, acting through heating when radiation is absorbed. For these thermal effects, frequency is important as it affects the intensity of the radiation and penetration into the organism (for example, microwaves penetrate better than infrared). It is widely accepted that low frequency fields that are too weak to cause significant heating could not possibly have any biological effect.[57] 
Some research suggests that weaker non-thermal electromagnetic fields (including weak ELF magnetic fields, although the latter does not strictly qualify as EM radiation[57][58][59]) and modulated RF and microwave fields can have biological effects, though the significance of this is unclear.[60][61] 
The World Health Organization has classified radio frequency electromagnetic radiation as Group 2B – possibly carcinogenic.[62][63] This group contains possible carcinogens such as lead, DDT, and styrene. 
At higher frequencies (some of visible and beyond), the effects of individual photons begin to become important, as these now have enough energy individually to directly or indirectly damage biological molecules.[64] All UV frequencies have been classed as Group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization. Ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure is the primary cause of skin cancer.[65][66] 
Thus, at UV frequencies and higher, electromagnetic radiation does more damage to biological systems than simple heating predicts. This is most obvious in the "far" (or "extreme") ultraviolet. UV, with X-ray and gamma radiation, are referred to as ionizing radiation due to the ability of photons of this radiation to produce ions and free radicals in materials (including living tissue). Since such radiation can severely damage life at energy levels that produce little heating, it is considered far more dangerous (in terms of damage-produced per unit of energy, or power) than the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
Use as a weapon
See also: Directed energy weapons § Microwave weapons
The heat ray is an application of EMR that makes use of microwave frequencies to create an unpleasant heating effect in the upper layer of the skin. A publicly known heat ray weapon called the Active Denial System was developed by the US military as an experimental weapon to deny the enemy access to an area.[67] A death ray is a theoretical weapon that delivers heat ray based on electromagnetic energy at levels that are capable of injuring human tissue. An inventor of a death ray, Harry Grindell Matthews, claimed to have lost sight in his left eye while working on his death ray weapon based on a microwave magnetron from the 1920s (a normal microwave oven creates a tissue damaging cooking effect inside the oven at around 2 kV/m).[68] 
Derivation from electromagnetic theory
Main article: Electromagnetic wave equation
Electromagnetic waves are predicted by the classical laws of electricity and magnetism, known as Maxwell's equations. There are nontrivial solutions of the homogeneous Maxwell's equations (without charges or currents), describing waves of changing electric and magnetic fields. Beginning with Maxwell's equations in free space: 
 
	(1)
 
	(2)
 
	(3)
 
	(4)
where 
	 and  are the electric field (measured in V/m or N/C) and the magnetic field (measured in T or Wb/m2), respectively;
	 yields the divergence and  the curl of a vector field  
	 and  are partial derivatives (rate of change in time, with location fixed) of the magnetic and electric field;
	 is the permeability of a vacuum (4π × 10−7 H/m), and  is the permittivity of a vacuum (8.85 × 10−12 F/m);
Besides the trivial solution  useful solutions can be derived with the following vector identity, valid for all vectors  in some vector field:  
Taking the curl of the second Maxwell equation (2) yields: 
 
	(5)
Evaluating the left hand side of (5) with the above identity and simplifying using (1), yields: 
 
	(6)
Evaluating the right hand side of (5) by exchanging the sequence of derivatives and inserting the fourth Maxwell equation (4), yields: 
 
	(7)
Combining (6) and (7) again, gives a vector-valued differential equation for the electric field, solving the homogeneous Maxwell equations: 
 
Taking the curl of the fourth Maxwell equation (4) results in a similar differential equation for a magnetic field solving the homogeneous Maxwell equations: 
 
Both differential equations have the form of the general wave equation for waves propagating with speed  where  is a function of time and location, which gives the amplitude of the wave at some time at a certain location:  This is also written as:  where  denotes the so-called d'Alembert operator, which in Cartesian coordinates is given as:  
Comparing the terms for the speed of propagation, yields in the case of the electric and magnetic fields:  
This is the speed of light in vacuum. Thus Maxwell's equations connect the vacuum permittivity  , the vacuum permeability  , and the speed of light, c0, via the above equation. This relationship had been discovered by Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch prior to the development of Maxwell's electrodynamics, however Maxwell was the first to produce a field theory consistent with waves traveling at the speed of light. 
These are only two equations versus the original four, so more information pertains to these waves hidden within Maxwell's equations. A generic vector wave for the electric field has the form  
Here,  is a constant vector,  is any second differentiable function,  is a unit vector in the direction of propagation, and  is a position vector.  is a generic solution to the wave equation. In other words,  for a generic wave traveling in the  direction. 
From the first of Maxwell's equations, we get  
Thus,  which implies that the electric field is orthogonal to the direction the wave propagates. The second of Maxwell's equations yields the magnetic field, namely,  
Thus,  
The remaining equations will be satisfied by this choice of  . 
The electric and magnetic field waves in the far-field travel at the speed of light. They have a special restricted orientation and proportional magnitudes,  , which can be seen immediately from the Poynting vector. The electric field, magnetic field, and direction of wave propagation are all orthogonal, and the wave propagates in the same direction as  . Also, E and B far-fields in free space, which as wave solutions depend primarily on these two Maxwell equations, are in-phase with each other. This is guaranteed since the generic wave solution is first order in both space and time, and the curl operator on one side of these equations results in first-order spatial derivatives of the wave solution, while the time-derivative on the other side of the equations, which gives the other field, is first-order in time, resulting in the same phase shift for both fields in each mathematical operation. 
From the viewpoint of an electromagnetic wave traveling forward, the electric field might be oscillating up and down, while the magnetic field oscillates right and left. This picture can be rotated with the electric field oscillating right and left and the magnetic field oscillating down and up. This is a different solution that is traveling in the same direction. This arbitrariness in the orientation with respect to propagation direction is known as polarization. On a quantum level, it is described as photon polarization. The direction of the polarization is defined as the direction of the electric field. 
More general forms of the second-order wave equations given above are available, allowing for both non-vacuum propagation media and sources. Many competing derivations exist, all with varying levels of approximation and intended applications. One very general example is a form of the electric field equation,[69] which was factorized into a pair of explicitly directional wave equations, and then efficiently reduced into a single uni-directional wave equation by means of a simple slow-evolution approximation.

With this information, we will have elements that allow us to go beyond the
“norm”, breaking limits of paradigms. This allows you to act by your account defining the
professional level at which you aspire, in all cases, to become superior. You are trusting
your own capability of learning, cultivating your natural creativity, and developing your
capability to integrate to your growth the different life areas and its environment. With
an original and purposeful thought, you will allow your experience to generate the fields
proposed and the circumstances required for your development.
Additionally, there are other questionnaires that base your knowledge on
empirical information. If you have taken any of the following questionnaires we want to
know the results. This will not affect your degree program, but will give you another
starting point for you to continue to grow. The following list contains a list of basic
questionnaire exams. Again, to reiterate, they are not required, they are absolutely
optional, except when the contrary is indicated by the advisor.

2 Theories of
International
Relations
The objective is to examine
critically the contemporary
relevance of different strands of
thinking about world politics,
the creation of various
contemporary “traditions” of
thought about International
Relations, the nature of
“theory” in world politics in
world politics, and the
relationship between ideas
about international order and its
historical evolution.
The course surveys the contributions to our
thinking about politics of several influential
Western theorists. The central focus is the
content and historical context of their writings as
well as some of the social and biographical
factors that influenced their thought.
For achieving the
objectives of this course, I
will research on a particular
topic and compile a
research paper of 15 to 25
pages.

main International
Organizations, particularly the
UN;
International organizations have joined the list of
the most important actors in global affairs. The
course distinguishes two types of international
organizations: intergovernmental organizations
(IGOs) and nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) and seeks to understand their past and
present function in contemporary societies and
international relations, focusing on IGOs and the
UN in particular.

5 International
Public Law
Learn about the creation of
International Public Law
through treaties, customs and
general principles.
States will be studied on many levels, including
defining the term "state", identifying its
attributes and determining how its responsibility
can be engaged. Other actors such as
international organizations will also be
considered, and individuals as subjects and not
only objects of IPL.

6 The Global
terrorism
Provide a working definition of
terrorism and evaluate the
nature of terrorist threats
globally; Analyze the terrorist
strategy and its weaknesses,
and Evaluate different causes
for terrorism; Analyze and
apply different aspects of a
counterterrorist strategy.
This course is designed to facilitate an
understanding of this rather malicious form of
political behavior. Over the course of this
summer session you will learn about terrorism
and counterterrorism with an emphasis on three
important areas of evaluation. The first section is
on terrorist action. Here we will review the
definitional dilemmas related to terrorism, learn
about the different forms of terrorism in the
world and the relative threat related to these
different forms, and evaluate the terrorist
strategy.
For achieving the
objectives of this course, I
will research on a particular
topic and compile a
research paper of 15 to 25

7 Issues in U.S.
Foreign Policy
The purpose of this course is to
provide students with the tools
to understand both the how and
the why of U.S. foreign policy
decision-making. The course
covers: the principles and
concepts of US foreign policy;
sources of American foreign
policy; the process, politics and
structure of US foreign policy
making; past and present
foreign policies and possible
directions for the future; and
competing interpretations of
American foreign policy
This course offers the student the opportunity to
examine the concepts and theories used by
scholars to make sense of past events, interpret
and analyse contemporary issues and predict
future developments in American foreign policy..
The making of US foreign policy is a complex
process, and the decisions made have tangible
and intangible consequences on the lives of
Americans and people all over the world.

3.4.4. HOW TO WRITE A THESIS
There are several ways to write a thesis. In the next pages there are many suggestions
on how to structure your thesis. Each section contains different examples, but they all
give you important guidelines.
3.4.4.1. RECOMMENDATIONS IN WRITITNG A THESIS (I)
This section contains a writing guide that includes basic, simple, but fairly pragmatic
advice about the process of writing a thesis. Here, we limit ourselves in giving you
simple ideas about how to start a thesis work, how to organize it, how to divide
apparently difficult tasks in small portions, and complete the tasks involved in each
portion. This section also includes details about the global structure of the document as
well as what specifically should be in each section of the writing. Because it was
intended for students with a Physics major, most examples relate to this particular arena
(José Luis Parented, February 2003).
CONTENT
Part One
GETTING STARTED
You need to make up your mind and plan your writing around: an outline, a sense of
organization, a specific work agenda, and a flow of ideas.
Part Two
A SUGGESTED THESIS STRUCTURE:
The overall plan should be as follows:
A cover page
An Abstract, Acknowledgements, Table of Contents, Introduction, Review of the
Literature
Middle Chapters, Chapter Structures, Materials and Methods, Investigative Theories
Results, Discussions, Conclusions, Bibliography, Appendices.
BEGINNING
At first, writing a thesis appears to be a daunting task that is considered difficult. In
fact, it is to a large extent. However, a deep feeling of relief will come after you complete
245
a couple of chapters. True happiness will follow when you approach the end because it
all boils down to the personal satisfaction to know the job is done and that one has
contributed a significant share to the world’s scientific knowledge.
Thus, let us assist you so that you can take off in a smooth way.
An Outline
First, prepare an outline of your thesis: write a sketch of the titles of the chapters,
subtitles, titles of illustrations (as planned placeholders for the results) and some other
useful notes. You must have a logical sequence of steps in the design of the plan and a
tentative final outline of the thesis, as the final outline of this work.
With this complete plan, you should make a relatively adequate list of virtually all details,
facts, and statements that are necessary to make the point of the thesis. With this
detailed outline, you will simply face the easy task to add a paragraph with some details
to every title in your sketch.
How to craft the sketch of a chapter?
The following routine has proved helpful to many:
• Gather all illustrations (tables, diagrams, anecdotes, etc.) that you plan to use.
• Put them in the logical order you would use for your own presentation.
• Practice to present the ideas to an acquaintance of yours (to test the waters, so
to speak).
• Soon after you fine tune your sequence, write down key transitional words for
that purpose.
• Immediately following this initial step of your outline, you should develop your
thesis. This first draft is important because:
• This would help generate the ideas you will actually use in the final version.
• This would assist you in defining a work agenda based on your own availability of
time
The Organization
Here, a physical (hard-copy) and electronic (soft-copy) o fan archival system for the
thesis can be extremely useful.
1. Have a folder containing all papers, manuscripts, recordings, photographs, etc.
For each chapter or main part of the thesis, another folder should also be
prepared for all correspondence on this particular topic.
246
2. As for the electronic archives, they should follow the same routine. Furthermore,
it is a good idea to create a file in your word processor containing specific words
related to each chapter and another for bibliographical referents. The reason for
this can be seeing when you think about finishing a chapter, those notes can
quickly become treasures or life saviors for your writing.
3. In each document, always have footer where you can write the version of the
document (date, time) along with some other important details such as page
number, for instance.
The Thesis Bureaucracy
While deeply involved with the thesis process, you should bear in mind there are
many administrative duties or obligations that go along with this. You must complete all
the necessary paperwork related to this endeavor in a timely manner as well.
Manage to ensure that you address every single issue, and follow your
previously fabricated agenda very closely. Above all, make sure bureaucratic issues
remain secondary in your agenda and do not hinder the essential process of your
scientific research
1. Prepare a work calendar
It is critical to plan your activities in detail. You should build a strict chronogram
together with your advisors. For those who are familiar with these programs, PERT and
CPM can help you achieve great results.
Try your best not to cheat yourself. In other words, plan activities you can afford
to complete. Build your agenda, indicate a submission date to your advisor and
EXECUTE the plan!
2. Make your ideas flow smoothly.
You could, for instance, keep a folder called “Ideas” where you would write down
all of the interesting data or ideas about your work. This could easily constitute an
excellent source of supporting details for your thoughts or statements.
Even when working away from your computer, it is still possible to generate and
write down ideas that hit your mind about the topic of your thesis. As soon as it
becomes possible, you can transfer such information to your “Ideas” folder.
Try to connect the ideas to each other in relation with the bulk work of your
thesis. Establish a relationship between your ideas and those expressed by other
247
authors prior to using them in your document. Use graphic organizers to accomplish this
conceptual work or better still, the SmartDraw program can be useful.
Part of the process includes your interaction with your advisor. Your Thesis
Proposal is very important as your advisor will be able to give you advice on what you
should add and what you should refine. You should not feel bad about these changes
because they will be intended to assist you with your thesis work.
Scientific writing being an art, takes time to both understand and assimilate.
When you understand the concept, you will become deeply involved with the process
and with all the implications of such involvement. The more you refine your work, the
better. Remember, writing is a process that requires many drafts to polish your ideas in
the best possible way to achieve the best results that you desire.
WHAT IS A THESIS? WHO IS IT INTENDED FOR? HOW DOES ONE WRITE IT?
Your thesis is a task of investigation and encompasses a problem that relates to
science. You should consider questions such as: What is the problem? What is it that
people already know about? What is to be done to solve it? What the results of your
research mean? What improvements you can suggest or recommend beyond the scope
of your thesis?
Please do not worry about traditional students’ examination: a thesis is not a
response to questions from an exam!
Readers of an exam are normally those with such response. They know how to
holistically evaluate your performance through an understanding of both the
components of the response, and your strengths and weaknesses with regards to the
topic.
Readers of a thesis, however, do not possess an “answer” to a given
hypothesis. Given the purpose of this work, the university requires an original
contribution to scientific knowledge: your research must discover something unique and
innovative to the world.
No one knows more than you do
A jury composed of experts in the field of your thesis will read your document.
Yet, absolutely no one knows more than you do... throughout the world! As a
result, it is essential to write clearly in order to make the jury’s job in analyzing your work
fairly easy.
248
Your thesis is a scientific document. As such, it will be consulted by many
researchers who will be looking for as many details as possible about your lab
experience and other related activities. Therefore, we urge you to keep this in mind and
try to digitize your work in microfilm, for example, for researchers.
Another word of advice is to have someone else read your draft and provide you
with suggestions that can be valuable. This can also help you to make sure your work is
being written correctly free of grammatical and spelling mistakes.
How much detail should you include?
Actually, it should be fairly more than in a scientific article! Soon after the
evaluation of your thesis and a quick reading of the first three pages by your friends,
only those deeply interested in your topic will find an interest in reading your complete
paper. For instance, a young researcher with a passion for your topic might be willing to
follow on your footsteps. Therefore, would your thesis be a solid reference in this
context?
Thus, you should be driven by a pledge to have your paper fully prepared with
all the useful details people might need: pictures, diagrams, compu
265
It is helpful to always have a clear plan of the project. What problem of investigation
will we analyze? How will it be carried out? Will we add to the work of our field or will it be
a documentary? Or, what are the axes of analysis that will be perfected to obtain the
raised objectives?
The structure
As far as how the thesis will be structured, there is not only one rule. Some
universities provide a basic scheme that there is to this respect, to the style:
Cover
Acknowledgements
Index
Introduction
Chapter 1: Problem of investigation, Objectives, Hypothesis, Variables and Method of
investigation
Chapter 2: Referential Framework
Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework
Chapter 4: Results of the study
General conclusions
Bibliography
If we have greater freedom to structure the thesis, then several alternatives appear.
As a general rule, the subject that we cho

4.6. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
At AIU, we encourage researching for the development of learning. Many, if not
all the time, most of the time, will read academic articles, periodicals, books, or other
publications. Keep in mind that while there is a lot of information, you need to be careful
to choose your resources wisely. Make sure you know the sources you are using are
trustworthy.
4.6.1. REFERENCES
There is great variety and useful information that you will use in your projects. It
is very important that you cite to reinforce the points you made with important
information. You need at least one reference in each page. Of course, more than one is
more beneficial to the value of your work. Remember, your work is a university
document and it has to indicate what others have done before you. Make sure you
consider works of notable writers and researchers.
It is also imperative that you cite your references the correct way. There are
various ways to use in text citations. You can use MLA, APA, or Chicago Style Manual.
Choose the style that you feel comfortable with. All of the styles have their own rules.
You must follow the rules from the moment you start writing the paper until you finish
with a work cited page, more commonly known as a bibliography. For more information
on bibliography, please review the bibliography guide by clicking here.

commitments. It is strongly recommended that you do not get involved with other
commitments when your course or term time is going on.
2.5 Know your Advisors
The most important thing is that you must know who your Advisors are. They are the
people who will be helping you throughout your academic life in AIU It is recommended
340
that right from the beginning of your course you must know who your lectures are. You
must know the following things:
• Name of the Lecturer
• The Subject taken by the Lecturer
• Day and Time of the Lecturer’s Class
2.6 Paying your Fees
You can pay your fees by PayPal, Western Union, bank transfer, or any other methods
of payment advised by the university. If you are experiencing financial difficulties, which

students. All information relating to academic and administrative matter is provided in the
Induction Pack. This helps you understand the following things:
• Relevant details relating to academic matters
• Administration process outline
• Guide to apply for letters and other facilities
3.2 List & Guide of Essential & Additional Reading 4 Academic Guidance
4.1 Tutor
As a student you will be allocated with a Tutor by the Institution. Your Tutor will assist you
to retain an interest in your personal and academic development throughout your
academic career. You can consult her/him for any of your academic matters. He/she is a
model of excellence for the students.
The Tutor will guide you through the subject he/she has been entrusted with. You will be
ensured by the Tutor that you are going through the whole curriculum properly. If you
have any problems or concerns regarding your studies, you can consult Tutor without any
hesitation.
Your Tutor is responsible for offering guidance in your academic work, monitoring
progress and initiating the provision of additional support where this may be
required. He/she is always prepared to fulfil a more generally supportive role and to
discuss any matters affecting your academic work. In cases where personal difficulties
are affecting your academic work, the Tutor may consider initiating appropriate
consultation with you and/or the Academic Advisor.
4.2 Academic Advisor
There is an Academic Advisor for each student enrolled at AIU. The Academic Advisor
deals with overall management of the academic affairs of the relevant discipline and acts
as a course leader. He/she is responsible for ensuring that lesson plans and practical
activities are relevant and appropriate. He/she conducts teaching observations on request
by the Academic Head or as part of the Institution's observation policy; gives feedback
342
and leads on where the quality of teaching needs to improve; and suggests development
activities etc. You can consult your Academic Advisor for any of your academic matters.
4.3 Academic Head
The Academic Head leads the Institution in the development and implementation of its
academic quality assurance and enhancement strategies and procedures. He/she is
responsible for ensuring that the academic sessions of the university run smoothly.
He/she is also responsible for advising and contributing to the development of the
university’s programs. You can consult the Academic for any of your academic matters
especially if you have any serious problems in making progress.
4.4 Revision Lectures
When all lectures are finished, you need to understand the style of questions and effective
ways to give answer to those questions. Although you may have full realization of the
topic, however, you may not be able to do well in the examinations, if you do not know
how to answer effectively or to the satisfaction of the examiners.
We have seen that although students have taken better preparation, they fail to achieve
good results because of lack of understanding of examinations techniques. AIU is keen
to provide revision lectures to prepare you explaining essential techniques of
examinations.
4.5 Academic Feedback
AIU is very much keen to prepare the students for their course of study. To prepare the
students properly the Academic Advisors provide feedbacks, written and oral. The
feedbacks actually provide details of strengths, weaknesses of the students and also
provide ways to improve the weaknesses.
The feedback also provides guideline to continuously develop their skills and analytical
ability in dealing with problems as posed by the questions. The purpose of feedback is
not to show the students what their difficulties are, but to show what they need to do to
develop in case of any difficulties.
4.6 English Language Support
343
AIU provides its registered students with free English Language Support in addition to the
main course. If you have any weakness in English or if you are advised by your tutor, you
can participate in English Language Support program free of cost. Furthermore, you will
get sufficient English Language books and other resources in the Library to enrich your
skills in English.
4.7 AIU Libraries

4.8 Brief Guide to Make Effective Plan of Your Studies
AIU strongly advise that you prepare your own study plan. This will help you make the
appropriate level of preparation 5. ACADEMIC OBLIGATIONS
5.1 Going Ahead with your Lectures
344
Students are strongly advised to maintain consistency with the class lectures. You must
follow the lectures in the class and be prepared for the lessons that you have decided to
create and work with. This in actual fact helps you follow your next lectures. Do not keep
your home-work pending until the last minute. This is very dangerous for any student.
Please try and avoid all attitudes that in the end jeopardize your academic life.
Going ahead with your lectures means following step-by-step, the process set out below:
1nd Step: Read your notes
2rd Step: Identify any point you do not understand
3th Step: Take an active part in the next lecture or seminar
4th Step: Correct your misunderstandings in that seminar or class
5th Step: Prepare additional notes for your better understanding and exams.
5.2 Submitting Coursework/Assignment
You must submit all the coursework/assignments in timely fashion. One of the main
purposes of assignments is to assess your understanding of a subject area. They also
serve other intellectual purposes:
• To organize your thinking.
• To bring a wide range of material to bear on a given problem or issue.
• To respond critically and with your own ideas to the issue.
• To select and use information to support an argument.
• To present this argument in a clearly structured and literate way.
Please note that failure to submit your assignments in due time may result in an
unsatisfactory progress in the final assessment.
5.3 Academic Progress
You are required to make overall significant progress in order to achieve your goal;
enhance your career prospect. You are permitted to proceed with your approved course
345
of study only if you maintain satisfactory progress as evidenced by turning in
assignments, satisfactory performance and the proper completion of such other work/task
as may be allotted to you. Please note that if your progress is unsatisfactory, you will be
given extra care and support and other relevant remedial measures to help you make
progress. At the same time, you will be warned about the consequences you might face
due to your unsatisfactory progress. If you persistently make unsatisfactory progress even
after pursuing our remedial measures under a given a period of time, you may eventually
be excluded from the University.
Further information relating to your Academic Progress can be found in AIU Policy and
Procedures on Monitoring and Reporting Students’ Academic Progress. You are
strongly encouraged to contact your tutor who will be able to assist you should you have
any queries regarding Academic Progress.
5.4 Re-Sits & Retakes
You are expected to finish your intended course on time in accordance with the advised
University course start and end dates.
5.5 Mitigating Circumstances
It is obvious that there are some circumstances that genuinely prohibit some students
from performing well in their studies. Please find the circumstances below that will be
considered in mitigation:
• Severe illness,
• Sudden accidents,
• Parental illness or accidents,
• Illness or accidents of the sisters, brothers, or close relations,
If you are faced with any of the above situations, you must immediately inform your
teachers, you will then be advised to put in writing. However, there is no automatic
guarantee that consideration will be given. Each case will be dealt with individually and
on merit.
6. ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT
6.1 Keeping Your Records Updated and Change of Address Notification
346
The University will update student records as necessary. It is your responsibility to ensure
that you notify the University immediately if there is any change in your contact details
e.g. address, telephone number, mobile telephone number, or any other change in your
personal circumstances. You can notify any changes by completing the Change of Details
Form which is available at the reception.
You must provide the details of your next of kin at the time of application and notify the
Institution immediately should there be any change pertaining to your next of kin.
Your whereabouts is very important for us to know. We will from time to time be sending
you letters and information in connection with your study with us such as attendance
notification letter, examination notice & schedules, examination admission notice, course
materials, or other kind of academic letters. Obviously, we will not be able to communicate
with you properly, if we do not have your exact address. So, make sure that you duly
inform us about any change in your address. If you do not give us your up to date address,
we will not be able to provide exact address details which will result the refusal of your
application to bank, reference etc. and most importantly, failure to notify your current
address to the University may even jeopardize your studentship at AIU.
6.2 Sickness Affecting Study Performance
AIU understands that no human has control over illnesses. It is natural that students may
suffer illness and therefore, students’ performances and attendance at lectures may
severely be affected. In such circumstances the students must see a GP to get medical
attention and treatment. The student who suffers illness must submit relevant documents
in support of his or his/her illness.
The Academic Committee of the Institution will decide about extra classes or extension
of time to submit coursework or assignment, if any. The academic committee will
communicate its decisions after due assessment of your case.

You are expected to conduct yourself responsibly when attending AIU. Misconduct may
result in you being suspended from the University. In such cases no refund of fees will be
given and any outstanding tuition fees will be payable.
7.1 Disciplinary Procedures
347
When you enroll on a program of learning at the Institution you sign and commit to a Code

below the standards required of the Code and are not resolved by informal discussion
and negotiation, then disciplinary proceedings may be started against you.
The disciplinary procedure is a formal process which applies to all learners enrolled at the
Institution. There are two types of activity in which disciplinary action may be required:

student has the opportunity to achieve their personal best. Part of the maintenance of that
positive environment is a fair and open complaints procedure made available to all
students.
7.5 Informal Complaint
This is a less formal procedure where a complainant may raise his or her concern about
the way the services were provided. The complainant simply may see the Academic
Advisor and orally inform the matter which will be dealt with immediate basis. However, if
the matter is serious and the complainant is utterly dissatisfied, the academic advisor will
rather accept the complaint as a formal one.
7.6 Formal Complaint
If a student or a visitor wants to bring a serious complaint about any matter in relation to
the way the services are provided, the complainant may bring a formal complaint. It
requires the complainant to take a complaint form from the reception. The complainant
may also additionally write his or her allegations in addition to filling the complaint form.

Annex D
Complaints Procedure
Policy Overview
AIU is keen to minimize all kinds of non-conformities and to encounter those non-
conformities through an established system of receiving and dealing with complaints.
Appropriate systems of receiving and dealing with the complaints provide the gateway to
learn the views of those who experienced the institution’s services. This gives AIU an
opportunity to rectify the non-conformities and thus brighten the image of the institution
when correctional actions to remedy the non-conformities are taken.
Who can complain?
The following people may bring complaints:
• those who are not satisfied with any services received from AIU;
• students (or those acting on student’s behalf)
• visitors
• service users
• staff members
Reasons for Complaints
Complainants may bring complaints for any of the reasons set out below:
• That the advice provided was not appropriate or wrong;
• That the personnel did not provide appropriate guidance;
• That the matter has been dealt with negligently;
• That the university did not update the complainant properly and in time, thus
complainant failed to take appropriate action and suffered loss and damage;
• That the complainant received substandard services;
• That the complainant had been misled about the matter;
• That the university did not deal with complainant’s problem expeditiously and thus
had caused him/her problems of a substantial nature;
• That the university has charged in excess of the fee scheme;
• That the institution had never provided the complainant with the services for which
he/she had already paid;
You may also add any other reasons that suit you most in your complaint. Please give
details of the reasons as much as possible. State your reasons clearly and without any
apparent ambiguity.
360
Purpose of the Complaints Procedure
The purpose of the Complaints Procedure is to establish an effective monitoring system
in the organization. AIU can identify any on-going irregularities or ineffectiveness of
systems, when there is a complaint about the matter from an interested party. The
complaints procedures are also used as indicators of standards of customer service that
have been successfully established and tested.
When a complainant approaches AIU with a genuine complaint, it is believed that the
complainant has given AIU a chance to rectify the errors or ineffectiveness or unfairness
in the system. It also helps AIU to take appropriate policy decisions after careful
consideration and investigation of the complaint. The most important purpose of the
complaints procedure is to ensure that no student leaves the organisation with bad
experience, dissatisfactions or grievance.
Informal Complaints Procedure
Introduction
This is a less formal procedure where a complainant may raise his or her concern about
the way a particular service was provided. The complainant may meet with the complaints
officer and discuss the matter that will be then immediately dealt with. However, if the
matter is serious and complicated and the complainant is still dissatisfied, the complaints
officer may accept the complaint as a formal one.
Report to the Complaints Officer
If a student, visitor, or other interested party is dissatisfied because of the way she or he
was dealt with, the dissatisfied person may complain about the matter. The Complaints
Officer will record the complaint in writing and will immediately look into the matter.
Investigation
The Complaints Officer will then immediately investigate the matter. If necessary, the
Complaints Officer will contact the department from which the complaint emanated. If the
complaint is able to be immediately resolved, the Complaints Officer will take a decision
as to the resolution of the complaint and inform the relevant parties. However, if it is not
possible to investigate the matter on the same day, the Complaints Officer will provide a
possible time frame to deal with the complaint, explaining to the complainant why it was
not possible to give a decision immediately. If, upon investigation, the Complaints Officer
feels that the situation is serious enough to warrant a formal complaint, the complainant
will be advised of this, and encouraged to pursue this.
361
Decision
If the Complaints Officer is able to resolve the complaint and provide a decision, this will
be done so orally, but should be followed by a written confirmation of the decision to the
relevant parties. A copy of the written decision must be given to the senior management
of the academic or the administrative head. If the Complaints Officer is unable to
satisfactorily resolve the complaint, the advice of the Senior Management Team may be
sought, or the complaint may be escalated to the status of a Formal Complaint.
Formal Complaints Procedure
If a complainant wishes to bring a serious complaint about any matter in relation to the
way services are provided, or the way thy have been dealt with, or if an informal complaint
has not been deal with satisfactorily, the complainant may bring a formal complaint.
A complaint form should be completed, with documentary evidence attached as
appropriate, and this should be submitted to the Complaint’s Officer for consideration. At
this stage, the documentary evidence submitted need not be the original copies.
Letter of acknowledgement
When the Complaints Officer receives a formal complaint, a letter of acknowledgement
will be sent. The letter must set out the next steps to be taken and indicate a time frame
of the investigation. The maximum time for an investigation will be four weeks.
Investigation
After receiving the formal complaint, the Complaints Officer must contact the department
or the member of the staff against whom the complaint has been brought. Details of the
complaint will be provided for their prompt response. The Complaints Officer will consider
the evidence brought by both parties, and may interview witnesses if appropriate in order
to accumulate further evidence.
Report of Findings
The Complaints Officer will report their findings in writing to the academic or
administrative head and will inform both parties in writing of his/her decision in the matter,
along with recommendations as to steps to be taken in order that the matter may be fully
resolved. The written decision must indicate the following:
• Background of complaint
• Summary of investigation
• Summary of evidence or documents and witness state 373
The following forms of academic misconduct are covered in the corresponding
numbered sections:
• Plagiarism;
• Cheating;
• Collusion;
• Falsification;
• Personation
• Plagiarism
Plagiarism includes:
o copying another student’s work;
o Aiding another student to plagiarise;
o Taking an essay, wholly or in part;
o Quoting without appropriate referencing from a magazine, a newspaper, a
journal, a book, a website or web-based essay bank;
o Obtaining premature access to test or examination papers.
o Violating copyrights and licensing agreements.
The use of AIU’s equipment to make illegal copies of copyrighted or licensed materials
is considered as serious as other forms of academic dishonesty. In addition to the
possible disciplinary action taken by AIU, the student may be faced with legal action.
• The close paraphrasing or summarising of material from other sources;
• Presenting ideas that were developed in collaboration with other students, with
no recognition of the contribution made by other members of the group.
• Self-plagiarism, whereby a student attempts to submit in a particular module a
piece of formative work which has already been assessed for another module
either at AIU or any other institution, is equally unacceptable. Work may be
based on research previously undertaken by the student, but this should be
acknowledged in the new piece of work to show the development in the student’s
thinking. Lecturers may ask to see the original work in order to compare the two.
Appropriate Practice
In their essays, reports, papers and dissertations, students should always give credit to
sources, whether quoting directly or paraphrasing. Information, ideas or quotations
obtained from any primary or secondary source must be acknowledged according to the
convention operated for that particular module or programme. Students who are
unclear as to procedure must seek advice from academic staff, as inadequate or lack of
374
appropriate referencing may result in disciplinary action ranging from the failure of a
piece of submitted work to permanent exclusion on the grounds of fraudulence.
Cheating
Cheating is acting unfairly, or dishonestly, to gain an advantage. Cheating by students
occurs mainly under examination conditions and is covered by the relevant examination
body’s own procedures. Cheating includes:
• Communicating with, or copying from any other candidate during an examination
except insofar as the examination regulations may specifically permit this, e.g.
group assessments;
• Communicating during an examination with any person other than a properly
authorised invigilator or another authorised member of staff;
• Introducing any written or printed materials into the examination room unless
expressly permitted by the partner awarding institution’s course regulations;
• Introducing any electronically stored information into the examination room,
unless expressly permitted by the partner awarding institution’s course
regulations;
• Gaining access to unauthorised material relating to an examination before or
during the examination;
• Obtaining a copy of an “unseen” written examination paper in advance of the
date and time of its authorised release;
• In any other ways, the provision, or assistance in the provision, of false evidence
or knowledge or understanding in examinations.
Guidance Note:
In this context the term examination is deemed to include tests carried out under
examination conditions.
Collusion
Collusion includes situations where a student:
• Submits as entirely his/her own, with intention to gain unfair advantage, work
done in collaboration with another person;
• Collaborates with another candidate in the completion of work which is intended
to be submitted as that other candidate’s own unaided work;
375
• Knowingly permits another candidate to copy all or part of their own work, and to
submit it as that other candidate’s own unaided work.
Guidance Note:
AIU encourages all students to share ideas and exchange reference material prior to
each student writing up their own personal presentation of an assessed piece of work.
Falsification
The presentation of data in laboratory reports, projects, etc. Based on experimental
work falsely purported to have been carried out by the candidate or obtained by unfair
means.
Personation
“Personation” is the legal term for what is usually referred to as “impersonation”.
Personation is the assumption by one person of the identity of another person with
intent to deceive, or to gain unfair advantage. It may exist where:
• One person assumes the identity of a candidate, with the intention of gaining
unfair advantage for that candidate;
• The candidate is knowingly and willingly impersonated by another with the
intention of gaining unfair advantage for the person personated.
Guidance on Academic Misconduct – Preventative Action by Staff
To prevent the occurrence of academic misconduct, AIU staff should:
• Inform students clearly of the Academic Misconduct Policy on academic integrity
and honesty and of any guidelines on academic misconduct, recording the
date(s) and occasion(s) for future reference;
• Include statements on academic misconduct in the Student Handbook;
• Make students aware of the penalties for academic misconduct at the earliest
stage of the course, e.g. a zero mark for the assessment, expulsion, etc.;
• Provide students with guidance on the format of formal acknowledgement of
source material;
376
• Inform students in writing if possible, of the extent to which they can collaborate
in coursework:
• Please refer to the notes in the guidelines from the awarding body as to what is,
and is not, allowed when collaborating;
• Be aware that most students are very computer literate and can scan text and
surf the web for model essays, etc., with ease;
• Ensure adequate access controls are in place and that learners are adequately
supervised when using computers (especially when networked) to prevent
learners from copying or printing out other people’s work as part of their own;
• Devise procedures for assessing work in such a way that plagiarism, cheating
and collusion are more detectable.
Procedures to deal with Academic Misconduct
All instances of suspected academic misconduct should be fully investigated utilising
the proper disciplinary procedures.
The determination of whether an instance of academic misconduct has occurred is a
matter for the AIU’s Course Co-ordinator. The allegations against the student should be
provided to the learner in writing before any action is taken, so that the learner is clear
of the case to be answered.
Minor instances of academic misconduct
Minor instances may be dealt with in accordance with the informal (verbal) warning
section of the Disciplinary Procedures, i.e. A verbal warning by the tutor, reported to the
Academic Head.
Examples of minor cases could include a student:
• Receiving undue help in good faith because instructions have been
misunderstood;
• Copying a couple of sentences or using someone else’s diagrams;
• Copying small amounts of text from books without direct acknowledgement,
• But which does not make a significant contribution to the overall work.
377
• Downloading from the internet without acknowledgement, using another’s disk or
copying work from another’s disk;
• Using another’s artwork;
• Not referencing work properly;
• Failing to acknowledge the source of a small section of an assignment;
• Infringing the Academic Misconduct Policy when the assessed work does not
contribute to final grade;
More serious cases of academic misconduct
More serious cases of academic misconduct should be dealt with through the formal
disciplinary procedure. The entire process will be governed by the AIU Disciplinary
Procedure as outlined in the Student Handbook. If the case is proven the following
sanctions may be imposed as appropriate:
• Notify the awarding/examining body, in line with their procedures;
• Inform external examiners/verifiers in line with awarding/examining body’s
procedures.
• Disqualify the student from the course.
378
7.2.7. ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT POLICY
Academic Misconduct Policy I
The following is conceded to be dishonest and therefore unacceptable and not allowed
by the Institution:
• Taking someone else’s work, images or ideas and passing it off as your own.
This is called plagiarism.
• Using the computer, either the Internet, or information stored on a hard copy or
floppy disk which belongs to someone else, and passing it off as your own.
• Cheating, that is, acting unfairly or dishonestly to gain an advantage.
• Secretly agreeing with another to cheat or deceive. This is known as collusion.
All these are called academic misconduct. If you are discovered or suspected of any
of the above, the Institution will investigate and this may result in disciplinary action
being taken.
That is what is expected of you whilst you are at Atlantic International University
1. You will only hand in your own original work for assessment.
2. You will show when you have used information provided by someone else by
giving the person’s name and where you found the information in your work (or in
your portfolio). For example, if you use someone else’s words you will enclose
the quote with inverted commas. You will also repeat this information at the end
of the piece in a bibliography or references section. Your tutor will give you help
with this. You should seek advice and guidance from tutors if you are unsure how
to do this properly.
3. You will show when you have downloaded information from the Internet.
4. You will never use another’s disk as if it were your own neither work, nor copy
work from a disk belonging to someone else and use it as if it were your own.
379
5. You will never use someone else’s artwork, pictures or graphics (including
graphs, spreadsheets etc.) as if it they were made by you or let other students
use or copy from your work and pass it off as if they had done it themselves.
ALL CASES OF SUSPECTED ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT WILL BE FULLY
INVESTIGATED BY THE INSTITUTION.
If proven disciplinary action will be taken. The outcome will depend on the severity of the
offence. The member of staff who has looked into what you have done will decide how
serious the case is at first and will then consult senior colleagues. The claims against your
wrongdoing will be written down so that you know the case you have to answer.
The following section gives information on this classification, together with guidance on
the actions the Institution will take.
Cases of Academic Misconduct include:
• Copying from books without acknowledgement which has a significant
contribution to the overall work
• Limited plagiarism from professional work (not course books).
• Limited copying of other candidates work (hard copy or from a disk), or excessive
help within one piece of work
• Limited downloading of information from the Internet or the use of model answers
downloaded from the Internet
• In the situation where the assessed work contributes to final grade
• Repeated minor cases
The Institution may take the following action:
• What you have done will be discussed with you in a private tutorial
• Your mark or assessment grade will be reduced or you will have work returned to
re-do and hand in for remarking or you will be awarded zero, depending on how
serious what you have done appears to the Institution
• You may not be allowed to take the course again
• You will be given a warning about how you must act in the future
Cases of Gross Misconduct include:
• Extensive copying of textbooks in one piece of work or limited copying in two or
more pieces of work which makes a significant contribution to the work/s.
• Extensive plagiarism of professional works (more than 100 words)
• Buying, selling or stealing of work
380
• Repeated evidence of extensive use of information from the Internet without
acknowledgement or using model internet answers
• Using past candidates’ work from previous years.
• Undue help from outside the Institution
• Repeated cases of misconduct
The Institution may take any of the following actions:
• A zero grade for the course is given or the assessed work is not awarded a grade
• You are not allowed to re-sit the exam or test, or you are not allowed to re-do the
piece of assessed work
• You are disqualified from your course
• You are excluded from the Institution
In all instances of academic misconduct the Institution may:
• Inform the relevant examining body what you have done, in accordance with the
Board of Trustees policy
• Inform external verifiers of what you have done, in accordance with the Board of
Trustees policy
In all cases, a note will be made on your record of the allegation, the outcome and any
penalty you are given. You need to know that this information may be used by the
Institution if it is asked to provide a reference for you.

Sci-bono Discovery Centre, Newtown, Johannesburg

Sci-Bono is a world-class science centre that supports maths, science and technology education and offers innovative, dynamic learning experiences that contribute to building South Africa’s science, engineering and technology capacity.

The words ‘don’t touch’ don’t exist at Sco-Bono. With almost 400 exhibits all the children and visitors are encouraged to touch, feel, press and play. They also host a range of travelling exhibitions at Sci-Bono such as the world renowned Body Worlds – cycle of life exhibition.

The Sci-Bono Discovery Centre is housed in the Electric Workshop, an early 1900’s building once used for repairs and maintenance of the old Johannesburg tramways. In the 70’s the building was no longer used and fell into disrepair. In 2004, the Gauteng Department of Education, partnered with the private sector, to create a major interactive science centre in this building – one of the city’s most ambitious urban regeneration projects. The new Sci-Bono Discovery Centre has become the largest science centre in Southern Africa.
